However, just a few years later, imported Kikkoman-brand shoyu was popular enough to sustain a growing presence in major supermarket chains across California and, a few years after that, through the Midwest and into the East Coast.  This shift demanded more than just a change in tastes and shopping habits: it indicated an expanding supply chain of companies bringing the Japanese product into the United States and onto restaurant tables and pantry shelves.  The paper will trace the postwar trajectory of Kikkoman-brand soy sauce in the United States through the story of a Japanese company seeking export markets, a Japanese American entrepreneur who helped to ignite Americans taste for Japanese food, and retail distribution systems that placed the once-exotic item to supermarkets across the country.  However, the paper will also argue that this was not just a story of international business: it also hinged on the choices and opportunities of the thousands of Japanese and other Asian Americans who moved from ethnic enclaves into new suburbs and residential districts.  Exploring the intersections between ethnic food practices and the big business of food distribution offers new insights into the shifting racial foundations of international business practices, as they furthered both U.S. expansionism in the Pacific and Japanese economic expansionism in the United States.</p>"," Into The Suburbs: Japanese Americans, Residential Integration, And The U.S. Expansion Of A Japanese Specialty Food"

Harding charged that Kings denunciation of economic inequality and militarism had been obscured by the celebration of his famed I have a dream speech. This criticism has been repeated often since, particularly when conservatives such as Ronald Reagan honored a sanitized representation of King as an American hero, as opposed to a radical who had urged Americans to conquer the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism.However, closer examination of King Days history reveals that holiday organizers sought to recall Kings radicalism during the presidency of Bill Clinton. When the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission, led by Coretta Scott King, transformed King Day into a day of service in 1994 it looked to Kings 1968 Drum major instinct sermon for inspiration. The Commission used the sermon, in which King preached everybody can be great because everybody can serve, to encourage Americans to imitate Kings activism through acts of community service.This paper argues that civil rights movement veterans and liberals reformed King Day in order to further what Jacquelyn Dowd Hall dubbed the long civil rights movement. To persuade Congress to change the holiday, reformers such as Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) and Sen. Harris Wofford (D-PA) invoked Kings radical denunciation of economic inequality. Clinton promoted the reform - which he connected to his community service agenda - in the hope of alleviating the effects of poverty.Research in the King Commissions little used archive, stored in the National Archives, uncovered Coretta Scott Kings correspondence and Commission meeting transcripts. These documents reveal that the Commission aimed to create a day on, not a day off, so Americans could continue the work of the civil rights movement. As a form of public history, King Day offered black and white citizens the space to commemorate King and engage with the past and the Commission sought to remember King as an activist. However, the archive and contemporary newspapers also illustrate that Dexter Scott King, Martin and Coretta&quot;s son, forced the Commissions closure at the height of its influence. He believed that it obstructed his plan to market his fathers intellectual property.The ensuing conflict between the Commission, a government agency, and Dexter exposed tensions between the open access of public history and the limitations imposed by private claims on an historical legacy. When the King familys agenda diverged from the Commissions, the familys economic interests prevailed; it became harder to mobilize Americans to participate in a day of action. Ultimately, the conflict narrowed the interpretive lens on Kings legacy, but this episode, and the Clinton era reforms, has been little analyzed by scholars. By examining the management of Kings legacy in the 1990s, this paper advances our understanding of civil rights movement history and public history. A digital visual presentation will accompany the paper and primary source materials will be available online before the conference.</p>"," A Day On, Not A Day Off: Transforming The Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday (1993–1999)"

This groundswell has most often been described through an analysis of masculinity, and indeed, white power activists organized as a paramilitary army, adopting masculine cultural forms and strict gender roles. White power activists outfitted in camouflage fatigues, trained in paramilitary camps, recruited veterans and active-duty military personnel, and obtained military-grade weapons and materiel. In this sense, white power represented an extreme variant of the paramilitary masculine culture then popular in the American mainstream.However, white power departed from paramilitary masculine culture in two important ways. First, the movement relied heavily on the supporting roles, auxiliary organizations, and social recruiting skills of women, who were often objectified by or excluded from mainstream paramilitary culture but nevertheless played important roles in unifying and sustaining white power as a social movement. Women served as potent symbols of movement ideology, brokered social relationships that cemented intergroup alliances, and worked to shape the movement from within. Second, the white power movement not only adopted paramilitary cultural forms, but also carried out a sustained course of violent action—one that created a real body count, and demands analysis and ethical engagement as something more than symbolic.</p>"," An Army For Her Husband: Women In The White Power Movement, 1975-1995"

Yet Grant had been engaged in helping to shape the narrative of Union victory and Confederate defeat from the summer of 1865, when he was composing his final report of operations, through his contributions to Centurys famed Battles and Leaders series in 1884 and early 1885. In interviews, correspondence and advice he shared his perspectives with newspaper correspondent John Russell Young, William T.

Many of the themes that later appeared in the Memoirs first surfaced during such exchanges, sometimes in more detailed form, reflecting not only a discussion of what happened during the war but also how postwar politics shaped wartime recollections. In setting forth his record, Grant responded to criticisms of his performance and the emergence of other lines of argument.

As one of the key pieces of technology that connected industrial modernity to personal mobility the bicycle quickly became a symbol of civilizational advancement. Beginning with Englishman Thomas Stevens circumnavigation in 1884-1886, American, Australian, and British adventurers sought to cross the continents and world by bicycle. Viewed as feats of human strength and technological ingenuity these travels were understood within imperial and racial frameworks. At the turn-of-the-century the bicycle was embroiled within a global discourse over the suitability of colonized peoples to industry. The paper examines the published and photographic records of American, Australian, and British cycling explorers Thomas Gaskell Allen (1894), Fanny Bullock Workman (1897), Albert Lloyd (1899), and Ted Ryko (1914). It explores the complicated intersections of race, gender, and class as they travelled across the United States, Australia, and globe. The paper centres on the staged photographs of the white adventurers as they proudly display their bicycle while astonished natives look on with either puzzlement or disinterest. Cycling circumnavigators frequently made use of such images to convey a colonized peoples inability to ride or understand the bicycle as proof of their unfitness for self-government. In doing so the paper aims to use a benign piece of technology such as the bicycle to trace trans-imperial discussions of race and ability and interrogate empire as a process emergent in the material practices of its citizens at home and abroad.</p>"," In Dwarf Land And Cannibal Country: Race, Empire, And Bicycle Circumnavigations"

The son of a middling Virginia farmer, Samuel and his brothers migrated west in the early 1800s to make their fortune in the new state of Alabama, and by the time of his death Samuel owned more than $200,000 in cotton, land, and slaves. As a successful cotton planter in a booming Southern state, Samuel Townsend could count himself among the social and economic elite—while he lived, hed lived the 19th century American dream. His nine children, however, occupied a social and legal status almost as far from Samuels as possible in the antebellum South: they were his slaves.The Townsend children—sons and daughters of a white cotton planter and several enslaved women—navigated between two families on Samuels plantation: the wealthy, privileged world of their father, and the extreme vulnerability of their mothers. And though Samuel emancipated his children in his will and left them the entirety of his large estate, the Townsends would continue to occupy a liminal space in American society throughout their lives as free people. Because of their inherited wealth and mixed-race ancestry, the Townsends defied easy categorization in a social hierarchy that equated African ancestry with powerlessness and inferiority—occupying a shifting space between whiteness and blackness, and social acceptance and rejection.The Townsends lives after their manumission in 1858 were marked by a search for belonging. In the following decades, Samuel Townsends sons and daughters also migrated westward, settling across Alabama, Ohio, Kansas, and Colorado. Because their racial identity was highly malleable—tied to individuals and communities differing and unstable perceptions of color and class status—the significance of the Townsends in-betweenness could shift dramatically from one region, state, or neighborhood to another. Their struggles and successes provide a window into how factors such as color and geographical location impacted African American men and womens ability to achieve social and economic mobility in the second half of the 19th century. The Townsends story illustrates how race relations and the very meanings of black and white could differ at fine-grained levels across the American landscape, beyond the conventional distinctions of North versus South.</p>","All The Townsends Are Well: An American Family And The 19Th-Century Landscape Of Race"

In many of his papers, Schomburg often described his discoveries or desired acquisitions as fragments, fragmentary items or fragmentary data, and at Schomburgs 1939 memorial, his close friend, Charles S. Johnson, also praised the then deceased Schomburg for his ability to combine these fragments into an inter-related whole. Schomburgs very process of collecting involved the assembling of records and art objects from far-flung regions, and his personal and institutionalized archive shaped these pieces into a comprehensible gathering despite its missing parts, uneven edges, and temporal, geographical, or material differences. This process by which inconsistent diasporic fragments were assembled into an imagined whole also embodies the 135th Street branchs early history, which housed the collection, because such a process accepted diversity, or the discursive relationships between similarities and differences, as a valued norm. This process also speaks to the connections between trained scholars and lay intellectuals who used the Schomburg Collections holdings including writers, artists, students, and interested community members. In particular, by relating Schomburgs usage of fragments to Jacob Lawrences Migration of the Negro painting series, this paper demonstrates how the discursiveness of diasporic collecting can operate as a conceptual framework for historical recovery that also incorporates non-traditional forms of history into African American historiography.</p>","An Inter-Related Whole: Understanding The Fragments, Frameworks, And Framed Works In The Arthur Schomburg Collection"

Public employment tripled in the quarter century after World War II, more than double the rate of increase in the private sector workforce. While the baby boom-fueled expansion of education was the most important driver of this growth, the shift also reflected growing demand for streets, sewers, and social and protective services. Despite John Kenneth Galbraiths famous lament about poverty of public goods, the postwar era saw unprecedented investment in the public sector. The growth of the welfare state created employment opportunities for millions of women, but these opportunities were conscribed in crucial ways by prevailing norms about the transient, supplementary nature of feminized work. Challenging these notions, millions of government women formed and joined labor unions during the three decades after World War II. Initially concentrated on professional and service work, in the second half of the 1970s organizing efforts increasingly shifted to the millions of clerical workers in government.This paper will explore those efforts through a case study of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). Faced with fiscal austerity and budget cuts, AFSCME women used both unions and the law to challenge reigning norms about the ease and simplicity of office work. By demanding that their labor be compensated on the basis of its complexity, difficulty, and responsibility rather than the prevailing rates in private industry, these women challenged the emerging neoliberal consensus about the sanctity of the market. </p>","Betty The Bureaucrat?: Clerical Workers And Comparable Worth In The 1970s"

In fleeing oppressive environments, fugitive slaves used holistic, environmental techniques to evade bloodhounds that were trained to perpetrate racial violence against their bodies. While recent scholarship divulges information on these unique animals and their position in slave societies throughout the Caribbean and US South, we still know very little of how these dogs were conditioned to sense race and the many ways black fugitives used environmental knowledge to evade their nonhuman pursuers. An Atlantic network of breeding, training, and sales facilitated the use of slave hounds to subdue human property, actualize legal categories of subjugation, and build efficient economic and state regimes. Drawing upon plantation journals, ex-slave testimonies, and published travel narratives I show that canines were an integral part in facilitating slaverys expansion and intimidating laborers. As dogs proliferated Atlantic slave societies in the late-eighteenth century, slave hunting was professionalized shortly after. However, black fugitives adapted to their environments using a variety of physical techniques and metaphysical concepts, reimagining spiritual ideas, agricultural innovations, and holistic remedies to survive American bondage and prevent canine brutality. Slaves easily outran their human trackers, but knew specialized knowledge was required to subvert the canines heightened olfactory senses and secure their escape. My paper examines this specialized knowledge, and argues that integrating canines into the environmental history of American slavery provides unique approaches to analyzing violence, resistance, and domination.</p>","Erasing The Scent: Canines And Slaves In The Slave South"

As the panel abstract notes, part of the appeal of a close examination of Florida&quot;s history is that so many larger stories intersect there: the earliest evidence of humans in the Southeast, the violent birth of Spanish Florida in the Atlantic World and various imperial struggles, the United States&quot; rise as a nation and the seizure of the peninsula and subsequent attempt to erase Native people and romanticize their past, and the persistence of those indigenous peoples. While William Bartram was a relative latecomer to Florida and certainly an outsider, he fell in love with the place immediately upon visiting it with his father, botanist John Bartram, in 1765. For the younger Bartram, Florida held vast natural beauty and the potential for prosperity as well. He attempted to start a plantation there, but this dream fell apart quickly, and he returned to Philadelphia in 1766. He revisited Florida on the eve of the American War for Independence as part of the journey that would eventually lead to his masterpiece, The Travels.

Hamelin was not alone in her disavowal.  Chroniclers of Detroit history from Frances Parkman to Henry Ford doubted the veracity of French oral histories and labelled their narrators unreliable.  The histories discounted by Hamelin, Parkman, and Ford, however, can be viewed instead as artifacts of community cohesion.

This presentation is a call for reclamation of community through reconsideration of hybrid songs that mark the rich shared culture between the French and indigenous nations.

This alteration was brought about in part by an influx of a young educated work force that fled the North in search of warmer climates and greater economic opportunities.  Bringing with them a white suburban political mindset, these transplants sought a governor who reflected their own ideology.  They found their champion in Claude Kirk, a successful businessman and political outsider who in 1966 became the first Republican governor elected in Florida since Reconstruction.  By playing the role of political outsider and providing plans to run the state like a business, Kirk found support from a frustrated public who viewed the entrenched Democratic political establishment in Florida as detrimental to the growth of the state.  Moreover, Kirks use of thinly veiled racialized law and order rhetoric played well to a white public who wanted to maintain their control but recognized that overt racism would be disadvantageous to the states economy.  This paper seeks to add new insight into to the rise of modern conservatism by placing Kirk and Florida in the center of this political shift.  Moreover, it will examine Kirks status as a political outsider to illustrate how modern conservatism has focused on a rejection of establishment politics and often embraced businessmen who sought to run the government as a business.    </p>","No Experience Necessary: Florida Governor Claude Kirk And The Rise Of Modern Conservatism"

However, the war exacted a deep social cost from those who fought and survived it. We have learned—from scholars such as Eric T. Dean, Jr., James Marten, Jeffrey McClurken, and Diane Miller Sommerville—that thousands of Civil War veterans came home damaged from their experience as soldiers. Their postwar lives were marked by alcoholism, fits of rage, violence, and depression. The most unhinged of these veterans were committed to state insane asylums for rehabilitation or custody. This story is becoming increasingly—if not disturbingly—familiar as more research comes out on Civil War veterans. But lost in this story, are the beliefs of the veterans themselves. This paper explores the contrasting beliefs of veterans and aylum doctors regarding the cause of mental illness among Civil War veterans. Asylum physicians argued that mental illness resulted from clinical conditions, such as chronic mania, which could result from poor moral decisions. Civil War veterans, however, believed and argued that the mental illness that afflicted their comrades, were the result of a vague condition they called played out or broken down. These terms were broad and were meant to convey the multiple physical and mental stressors of the war. These terms organically spread among veterans as a soldiers explanation for mental illness. This could insulate them from shame and later helped them win pensions in the postwar years. </p>","Played Out: Veterans' Interpretations Of Mental Illness "

Headlines abounded such as, &quot;Still Another Heiress Marries a Coachman...&quot; and &quot;Another Coachman Favored.&quot; The sensationalism of the coachman/heiress pairing entered the realm of pop culture through songs and cartoons.

While some outlets framed the interracial relationships as freaks of nature, others told the stories as charming modern love tales, even though it was decades before interracial marriage was legal nationwide.  One couple got around the legal barrier by having the white heiress paint her face with dark make-up so that the minister thought the couple was African American rather than just the groom.

Consequently, Spanish anarchists including Pedro Esteve, editor of Cultura Obrera based in New York, began communicating with activists on the West Coast, the most prominent of whom was the Mexican anarchist, Ricardo Flores Magón, editor of Regeneración. By examining these shifting print and communication networks, we can discern the ways in which the anarchist movement of the 19th century was evolving in the 20th century. This presentation will therefore examine the movement between the two coasts of Hispanic anarchists and their ideas during the early twentieth century; specifically, it will explore the ways in which first generation Spanish anarchists interacted, and sometimes clashed, with Mexican anarchists embroiled in a revolutionary movement of their own.</p>","The New York-California Connection: Spanish Anarchists, Revolution And The Radical Press, 1900-1930"

Unfortunately, the spirit did not go away and would be one of a number of factors that would contribute to Hookers inability to win the victories Lincoln hoped for in 1863.  Of course, Lincolns letter and his efforts to work with Hooker played a significant role in the course of the war and, consequently, have occupied a central place in how posterity has studied and remembered the Union war effort.  This paper will look at the Lincoln-Hooker relationship and how history has remembered it and its place in the Union war effort.

The split came after a long dispute over the relationship between folklore and science, the role of social science in democratic society, and the importance of professionalization in the production of knowledge. Over the objections of anthropologist Franz Boas and the American Folklore Society, the upstart Texans, led by University of Texas professor J. Frank Dobie, insisted that the unique value of folklore lay in its ability to challenge prevailing cultural and institutional assumptions about science, society professionalization, and modernization. Dobie believed that folklore studies was an art wherein the subject, the storyteller, and the audience all participated in enacting a tradition; Boas feared that this violated the standards of objective science so important to the social utility of the scholars work. Above all, the Texas Folklore Society represent the view that social science-- particularly folklore-- could be used to enchant and mystify, rather than categorize and clarify, the world. This paper reconstructs the Texas-national dispute, using records of the National Folklore Society and the papers of J. Frank Dobie. With this story, I aim to excavate a dissenting discourse of social science that elevated imagination and enchantment over professionalization and standardization.</p>","There Ain't No Texas Branch: Science And Imagination In The American Folklore Society"

Operating under the control of the State Department but with close ties to the National Security Council, the Office of Public Diplomacy worked to influence public opinion in favor of the United States intervention in Central America through white propaganda distributed in the U.S. media and in academic and policymaking circles. Drawing on recently declassified U.S. government documents, archival collections of former U.S. policymakers, as well as archival research in Nicaragua, I argue that the Office of Public Diplomacy exemplified the Reagan Administrations embrace of human rights rhetoric, centering on democracy promotion, to justify U.S. interventionism in Central America. Specifically, the administration energetically utilized the lexicon of human rights to portray U.S.-funded counterrevolutionary forces seeking to destabilize the leftist government of Nicaragua as anti-communist democrats, despite evidence of widespread human rights abuses. Correspondingly, the Reagan Administration worked to delegitimize the social and economic human rights initiatives of the Nicaraguan revolutionary government. The Office of Public Diplomacy played a signal role in both projects, and I contend that over the course of the decade it contributed to the emergence of a distinctive form of U.S. political and economic interventionism during the Reagan era, with significant implications for post-Cold War international relations.</p>","'We Were Telling The Truth About Central America': The Office Of Public Diplomacy And The Reagan Administration's Low-Intensity War On Nicaragua"

José Agustín Quintero, a poet-journalist refugee from the 1848 López conspiracy in Cuba, had come under the influence of former Texas president Mirabeau Lamar and emerged an ardent Southern nationalist. The guns of secession found Quintero assigned as confidential commissioner to the Mexican border with Texas. A site of Confederate cotton trade, desperados and caudillo fortunes, there Quintero adroitly entreated with the local fiefdom of Santiago Vidaurri, governor of the Mexican states of Nuevo León and Coahuila. As the war progressed, Quintero would successfully represent the Confederacy with the imperiled President Juárez and the forces of a usurping Emperor Maximilian. Part of Quinteros success lay with his network of exiled Cubans located in Mexico, such as Pedro Santacilia, private secretary and son-in-law to President Benito Juárez. At the same time, Quinteros literary aspirations provided opportunities to cement strong relationships in Mexico, such as with Mexicos national poet, Guillermo Prieto, who also served Juárez as minister of finance. To this succession of Mexican authorities Quintero delivered taxable Confederate cotton trade when the Lincoln administration promised loans that never arrived. Such lucrative trade helped sustain the Juárez government as it sought to elude the grasp of Maximilians forces; however, at the same time, it also ensured the survival of the Trans-Mississippi Department as a virtually separate Confederate nation after Vicksburg.  </p>","A Cuban Diplomat In The Confederacy: José Agustín Quintero And The Mexican Cotton Trade"

Historiographically, senator Long has been circumscribed to the American scene, mostly Louisiana. This paper aims at analyzing his persona and political thought and leadership style in the broader Greater Caribbean. This transnational region encompasses the Caribbean Sea islands and countries as well as part of the South US. I will argue that similar historical, political, economic, and social dynamics of the 1920s in that region promoted the rise of comparable politicians, such as Gerardo Machado in Cuba or Rafael Leónidas Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. These politicians found similar solutions to problems their respective societies were experiencing by developing impressive public works programs, improving education and sanitation, and inspiring a strong cult of personality, at the same time they gathered unprecedented power in their hands. This new perspective will allow us to better comprehend the rise of Huey Long, to debunk the stereotypical idea of American exceptionalism, and to focus on the connections rather than the differences between north and south America or Anglo and Latin America.</p>","A Greater Caribbean Caudillo: A New Look Upon The Kingfish Of Louisiana"

Advocates against sexual assault have used Title IX as a powerful lever to force administrations to address rape. As a result, universities and colleges have developed significant orientation and training programs on consent to prevent sexual assault.  This discussion, both in the media and higher education, has proceeded with a presumption that the attention to consent has only recently arisen within college administrations and student affairs programming. This paper argues that questions of consent and their correlations with sexual assault have a much longer history in higher education which stretches back to the turn of the 20th century. Higher education historians have catalogued significantly the development of sex education and the influence of the sexual revolution on college campuses. However, little research has considered how the academy taught college women and men to regard consent, and how coeducational institutions dealt with sexual assault on campuses before Title IX.   The efforts regarding consent have gone unnoticed because, as Margaret Nash has argued, the entire field of the history of higher education posits a progressive trajectory of increasingly democratized access, which centers around men and the male norm in higher educational institutions.  This historical discursive treatment has eclipsed the pre-Title IX practices which evolved out of academic womens work on the female side of the sex-segregated academy. One reason for this is that womens work on consent developed in the area of student affairs—which has only recently been recognized as a development by women for women college students. In reality, deans of men (who later became deans of students) appropriated from women the student affairs profession in the middle of the 20th century, and this caused much of the womens work regarding feminism and social justice to be forgotten.  Compounding this, the work regarding consent and sexual assault resided within the discourse of safety which has long been used to produce and maintain traditional gender roles, and which actively limited womens access to the full academy that men enjoyed.  These factors have caused historians to overlook feminist activity regarding sexual assault within the sex-segregated academy.This paper details the known parameters of the history of consent before Title IX as it arose on college campuses through student affairs. It considers the development of the safety discourse, and the ways in which this constrained and enabled an intergenerational partnership between academic women and female students to develop protections against sexual assault, and to educate women regarding consent and heterosexuality. The material is derived from primary sources in the records of the National Association for Women in Education, the Intercollegiate Association of Women Students, fraternity publications, and student affairs records at majority and historically black coeducational universities. It also considers the links between female administrators and the development of womens physical education, the Young Womens Christian Association, and womens student government.</p>","A History Of Consent"

Their main cause of action was the failed ratification of eighteen treaties the United States made with California Indians in 1851 and 1852.  Bringing the undelivered promises of the treaties back under public scrutiny a half-century later, reformers successfully lobbied Congress to authorize the state of California to sue the United States on behalf of the Indians of California, a class entitled to equitable compensation for undelivered treaty promises.  What many hoped would be, as one intertribal Indian organization put it, a just and final disposal of the California Indian problem, became a foundation of the revived governance of a California Indian Country that included many more Indian tribes, reservations, and people than the treaties ever acknowledged.  This paper considers the politics of Indian policy reform in California.  It begins with the question of how treaties that were never ratified became the focus of a public debate about the states Indian history.  It will also consider where historically minded non-Indian reformers ideas of justice intersected with and diverged from Indians conceptions of their history in post-statehood California.  Indians regularly focused their political action on the problem of how to acquire land.  In examining how forms of historical interpretation of the nineteenth century shaped and delimited Indian rights claims in the early twentieth century, this paper will assess the possibilities for, and constraints on, Indian political action in the twentieth century.</p>","A Just And Final Disposal: The History And Politics Of California Indian Land Before The Indian New Deal"

This paper examines soldiers letters, diaries, and memoirs, as well as the papers of the Army and welfare organizations to place the feelings of millions of soldiers in the American Expeditionary Force and thousands of women serving in welfare roles on equal footing with the goals of the Army, YMCA, and other welfare agencies.  Although Army officials demanded rigorous physical training from new recruits and YMCA workers encouraged soldier participation in tournaments like the A.E.F. and Inter-Allied Games, individual doughboys batted baseballs behind the trenches in informal games and cheered in stadiums as audiences more than 30,000 strong.  Soldiers and welfare workers therefore made personal choices on whether to engage with athletics informally or as part of a program, locally or as part of a mass, and as a participant or a spectator, important decisions that mirrored the those Americans made every day both in the United States and over there.  By jointly examining personal and institutional perspectives on sports during the First World War historians can illustrate how both individuals and institutions shaped the development of American athletic culture and more accurately describe the American society they returned home to as veterans. </p>","A.E.F.

Yet it declined to include her case, and others like it, in its sex discrimination lawsuit or race discrimination lawsuits against Sears in 1979.  As a result, these cases grappled primarily with offenses against white women and African American men.  But what about black womens grievances?  My paper considers the Sears cases and their implications for black working women.  It argues that African American women workers engaged government and corporate programs to advance fair employment and affirmative action policies and propel them into the middle class.  However, they soon learned that neither the government nor Sears (nor the retail industry, generally) would be effective allies in meeting this end, compelling black women to pursue other avenues.  These entities were unable, or perhaps unwilling, to understand the five-decade movement to integrate department-store work and consumption – an endeavor for and by African Americans, most often led by its female members – or recognize the intersectionality of black womens oppression.

In speeches, political tracts, and novels, white and African American suffragists challenged denigrating stereotypes of old women as foolish, isolated, and irrelevant, while promoting female aging as a source of wisdom essential to national progress.  By staging grand celebrations of aging leaders, they designed forms of political protest that emphasized seniority as a qualification for leadership and promoted modern day &quot;matriarchs&quot; as the protectors of women and children.  The effort to redefine grandmothers and spinsters as political leaders crossed the color line, but was not without racial tension.  White suffragists emphasized the education and wealth of prominent Anglo Saxon elders, while black suffragists sought respect for the folk wisdom and survival skills of aging freedwomen.  Both white and black elders faced a backlash at the turn of the twentieth century as activists equated liberation with the spirit of youth—a theme addressed by Miya Carey on this panel—and age prejudice against older women intensified—as Vanessa May will explain in her paper.  As the recent Presidential election demonstrated, women running for political office still contend with negative attitudes towards old women.  Recovering the significance of age in the woman suffrage movement will both enrich the narrative forms through which we understand history and, perhaps, equip us to better understand persistent obstacles to women&quot;s empowerment.</p>","Aging And Woman Suffrage, From The Biographical To The Political: Reconsidering The Historical Genres Through Which We Understand The Significance Of Age In American History"

Before Henry Clays well-known speech, the former Treasury secretary established a network that extended from New York Citys learned societies to local clergymen and philanthropic associations to regional contacts and locally prominent men. He then mobilized newspapers and the post office to disseminate an argument against the war—based on its cost and its dubious justification—even in the West. The details of this effort and its reception across the country are recorded in a remarkable scrapbook. A concern with bellicose expansionism directed against neighbors was deeply rooted in Gallatin&quot;s Genevan heritage and he doubted that the union could encompass territories stretching to the Pacific. Yet, what he considered an unjust war also promised a windfall of ethnological knowledge concerning the possibility of indigenous social development (e.g. Pueblo peoples). Building on work on antebellum voluntary associations, print culture, and communication networks (e.g. Johann Neem, David Henkin, Richard Johns); the place of public finance in politics (e.g. Robin Einhorn, Max Edling); and opposition to the U.S.-Mexican War (Robert Johansson, Amy Greenberg), this paper argues that Gallatin&quot;s efforts reveal the complementary roles of learned societies and religious organizations in allowing prominent men to parlay wealth, reputation, and local weight into national influence in a representative democracy through the public sphere.

A baton mishap by the favored Australians provided an opening for the unheralded American quartet of three black young women, Mae Faggs, Barbara Jones, and Catherine Hardy, and one white young woman, Janet Moreau. But the U.S. did not claim victory solely due to Australias misfortune; the interracial foursome earned their victory, as evidenced by the fact that they set a new world record in route to gold.  In the context of the sporting Cold War, which recently had ignited due to the re-entry of the Soviet Union in the Olympic Games, the U.S. womens relay triumph presumably should have inspired much praise.  However, the white and black U.S. sport presses proved unimpressed by the unexpected gold.  After offering muted compliments, both white and black sportswriters primarily used the womens relay victory to offer continued criticism of U.S. womens track, emphasizing their lack of talent and ability. Although curious, the demands and conditions of the Cold War explain this response.  With the Soviet Unions participation in the 1952 Games, U.S. sport officials, along with white and black sport media, considered the Games an opportunity to present a pluralistic vision of American masculinity, with white and black male athletes cooperating to win victory. Yet voices of athletic authority proved uncertain as to what an interracial cohort of female track athletes communicated about the nation.  Ahead of the Olympics, sportswriters of both races emphasized the youth of the womens track team, suggesting victories would remain elusive for the inexperienced American squad. While the team did feature nine female athletes under age twenty, the attention to age served larger ideological purposes, allowing male sport commentators to avoid reckoning with these young women as athletes who potentially troubled prevailing expectations of gender, race, and athleticism.  In white sport culture, attention to the youthfulness of female track athletes implicitly positioned sport as a temporary endeavor, thereby not threatening the insistence on the inherent femininity of white American women.  The focus on youth served a similar purpose in black sport culture.  As part of the broader effort for African American rights, black sport writers prioritized the achievements of black male athletes, with youthfulness of black female athletes accentuating the masculine capacity of black male athletes. The U.S. womens relay victory in Helsinki thus disrupted the ideological equations established by white and black sport cultures.  In reaction, sportswriters emphasized the lack of success attained by U.S. women, lamenting the fact that they scored no other victories.  The shifting estimations of U.S. womens track provides a perspective of the ideological operation of age, gender, race, and sport at the outset of the sporting Cold War.  A comparative analysis of the coverage of womens track before and after the 1952 Games illuminates how the athletic success by women challenged expectations of gender, race, and athleticism in white and black sport cultures. </p>","All That Is Gold Doesn't Glitter: The 1952 U.S. Women's Gold Medal Relay Victory And The Uncertainties Of Female Athleticism"

He argued that European interest in Africa was purely economic, contending that Europeans saw the continent not as a land to civilize or explore, but rather as a place to be occupied. He predicted that European colonization would follow the establishment of trade relations in Africa, making explicit comparisons between the colonization of the Americas in the early modern period and the situation in Africa.

Native Americans ideas about and practices of citizenship were shaped by the passage of the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act, which granted them U.S. citizenship whether they wanted it or not, and the economic and environmental exigencies of the 1930s.  During the so-called Indian New Deal (1933-1945), federal policy-makers promoted new American Indian political structures to assimilate Indian people into the national political economy, but did so by allowing for voluntary elections on tribal constitutions and charters of incorporation.  American Indians debates on these political changes reveal the bitter legacies of colonialism and the promises of renewed indigenous governance.  Native American politicians and citizens reimagining of reservation space during the 1930s via new legal instruments and conservation measures became an important means to protect Indianness on Indians terms and contest assimilation.  The paper will address the ways in which American Indians wrestled with the politics and policies of the New Deal era to assert their particular vision of citizenship.  As a historian of twentieth century American Indian political and environmental history who has situated that history in an international context, most recently in a 2009 book (Serving Their Country: American Indian Patriotism and Politics in the Twentieth Century, Harvard University Press) and a 2013 journal article (Modern America Desperately Needs to Listen: The Emerging Indian in an Age of Environmental Crisis, The Journal of American History), I welcome this opportunity to discuss with fellow scholars of the New Deal era and of American citizenship more broadly a core element of my new book project, tentatively entitled Citizens of the World: A History of Native American Citizenship (under contract with Cambridge Univ.

Experiential archaeology—flintknapping, for instance—has the standing of a method of analysis that helps scholars more fully understand the past. We lack an equivalent practice in history and prioritize sources that we interact with mainly as readers, observers, and listeners: documents, visual materials, and oral histories. The experiential in the discipline of history seems more common as a mode of presentation, not analysis, and occurs most often at public history sites as reenactors and museum interpreters in costume demonstrate what the past was like. In the case of soap, I have questions that could be answered by doing. Does tallow (throughout history one of soap&quot;s main ingredients) smell? How dangerous was it make lye from ashes? How hard exactly was the crown soap that Benjamin Franklin boasted of to acquaintances? (He came from a family of Boston soap boilers.) Specifically, my presentation will discuss three kinds of experiential history I am employing in my research: fieldwork to fields and factories where the oils that make soap are produced, an amateur chemistry set so that I can understand the chemical processes that transformed soapmaking in the 19th century, and manufacturing my own soap using historic recipes.</p>","An Experiential History Of Soap"

While the death toll alone is staggering, the number of wounded soldiers left altered for life is far worse. In the post-war period, the medical and social perceptions of insanity did not change drastically. Instead, society and the government distributed aid and support based on the same foundation of physical and moral causation as during the war. As a result of these continued perceptions of insanity, veterans organizations and commemorations served as a coping mechanism in addition to the political and social purposes already studied by historians. At the same time that veterans organizations, such as the Grand Army of the Republic, acted to commemorate their participation in the war and push for veterans benefits in the post-war period, these groups also provided veterans support systems that helped those struggling to survive and those struggling with their wartime experiences. Just as during the war, veterans used networks of comrades and reunions to cope with wartime experiences in the post-war period. This paper will examine how veterans used organizations such as the Grand Army of the Republic as primarily a coping mechanism in the post-war period. Built as a fraternal organization, the GAR served first as a support organization for veterans, a space for veterans to gather with others who understood their experiences and worked together to support those struggling after the war.</p>","An Organization Of Brothers: The Grand Army Of The Republic, Civil War Veterans, And Coping With War"

These lessons often derived from the Munich Conference of 1938 and the failure to prevent a Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. But other uses of history within the Johnson administration in relation to wartime policy have gone unaddressed. In particular, how the intelligence community used history to formulate estimates of Hanois future behavior has been all but ignored. Using recently-declassified documents to examine this question reveals much about how top Johnson administration officials used different forms of history to help form arguments for their preferred policies.Throughout the Vietnam War, the intelligence community could not break enemy communication codes and never managed to cultivate high-level human sources in Hanoi. As such, using history was one of the primary methods by which the intelligence agencies sought to understand their enemy. Unlike policymakers who used historical analogies drawn from World War II or Korea, the intelligence agencies examined the Hanoi governments behavior during the First Indochina War and the subsequent peace talks. Doing so led to much more accurate appraisals of potential enemy actions. Yet most policymakers ignored these reports. Instead, they favored appraisals drawing from World War II and Korea that confirmed their preconceived notions on Vietnam. Analogies that spoke to individual policymakers personal experiences often prevailed over specific examples drawn from Hanois previous actions. Thus, much accurate intelligence went ignored.</p>","Analogical Peril: Intelligence, History, And Policy In The Vietnam War"

Stassens election would be unremarkable—his positions on most major issues were similar to Wendell Wilkie and Earl Warren—except for the intensely anti-Semitic character of the campaign. Ray P. Chase, a Republican stalwart in the state, waged an anti-Semitic smear campaign against the incumbent Farmer-Labor candidate, Elmer Benson, who was seen as too close to Jewish interests in Minnesota.  Chase, a former GOP congressman, had close connections to the Minneapolis business community and to prominent figures on the far right on the national stage, including William Pelley and Gerald L.K. Smith. Chase was far from the only anti-Semitic voice in Minnesota politics, but his prominence in the right wing of the state Republican Party, as well as the fact that Stassen refused to condemn Chases smear campaign and reaped political benefits from it. University of Minnesota labor historian Hyman Berman wrote the hitherto definitive work on the 1938 campaign from which much of my initial framework is drawn, but unlike Berman, who wanted to emphasize Minnesotas uniquely anti-Semitic social history, my paper will highlight the close and often symbiotic relationship between far right anti-Semites and more mainstream Republican politics using the 1938 election as a case study.</p>","Anti-Semitism In The Anti-New Deal Conservative Coalition"

The proceeds of this sale were essential to underwriting the financial stability of the small school that would grow into Georgetown University. The first mention of Jesuits owning slaves appears in the historical record in 1717. Caught in the compromising political climate that threatened their ability to practice their Roman Catholic faith, the Jesuits hunkered down in rural Maryland to support their religious work through farming, first with the help of indentured servants and then with the labor of enslaved persons, many of whom they inherited or received as gifts from wealthy lay persons in the area. The number of slaves owned by the Maryland Province Jesuits grew dramatically—to 192 persons in 1765 and then to 272 persons by 1838, many of whom were children or those past the age of fruitful labor in 1838 when the men decided to rid themselves of their slaves, wholesale. While much historical work has been written on the Jesuits and slavery, that writing has primarily focused on the moral universe in which these religious men made their decisions about slaveholding. Thus far, however, no scholar has studied the enslaved people themselves. Therefore, my paper will focus first on the lives and experiences of the enslaved, rather than on their Jesuit owners. Beginning in 1717, I will note every subsequent appearance of an enslaved person associated with the Jesuit community as I revisit the sources that slowly reveal the conditions under which these individuals labored and lived. With an eye to the events and relationships that made up the daily lives of this enslaved community, I will work to identify each enslaved person and to situate them within their families and larger community. Using digital analysis and presentation methods, I will build up a network of biographical and relational linked open data about them to answer several key questions: •How did these individuals come to be enslaved and to be owned by the Jesuits? •What were the material conditions of their lives? •How were their families created and sustained?•How were the young and elderly treated? My work will help scholars of slavery to understand more deeply the characteristics of slavery in the Chesapeake. Also, the work will allow me to ask, in a twist on William Thomas and Edward Ayers phrase, what difference did Catholicism make? Prescriptions about not separating families and ensuring that enslaved persons could practice their religion dot the historical records in which the Jesuits discuss their obligations as slaveholders. But, until these statements are reconciled to the actual historical conditions and the circumstances of enslaved persons throughout the region, we cannot fully evaluate how these peoples experiences of slavery differed from others in the Chesapeake.</p>","As Justice And Charity Demands:  An Examination Of The Enslaved Persons Owned (And Sold) By The Maryland Province Jesuits, 1717-1838"

Against the eras received wisdom, they encouraged one another to live more naturally: to give birth without drugs (and sometimes at home) in order to experience this rite of passage more fully; to room with and breastfeed their babies to encourage attachment; to sew their own baby carriers so as to keep their babies close and contented; to sprout alfalfa seeds and make their own homemade yogurt for better health. By the late 1960s, in the wake of a broader countercultures skepticism about traditional figures of authority, this movement entered the mainstream, and it has remained an influential force in parenting (and particularly in mothering) ever since. My paper traces this parental counterculture from its emergence in the postwar era to the early twenty-first century, considering its rising influence at a time of widening skepticism about traditional authority and exploring some of its offshoots in more recent years, from the influence of Dr. William Sears attachment parenting from the 1980s onward to recent debates about extended breastfeeding. Based on extensive archival research, this paper considers natural parenting as a lens through which to situate the longer trajectory of the counterculture; explores modern (and nostalgic) constructions of the natural; and examines how women have wielded the banner of natural parenting toward communal, political, and business ends.  Natural parenting has been the source of significant commentary, if less often by historians than by journalists. While some have termed these efforts emancipatory, others have criticized them as anti-feminist or regressive. For instance, even as the La Leche League (an organization founded by women to support other women in breastfeeding) grew rapidly in the 1960s, many working mothers found the groups insistence on mothers staying home with their babies both unrealistic and guilt-inducing. An era of greater consumer choice in parenting, made possible in part by the counterculture, led to empowerment for some (particularly for better-off women, some of whom argued that their strategic removal from the paid workforce was morally valuable); it also led to anxiety about doing the right thing once that thing was less well-defined. American parents have disagreed about how baby-led they should be, and have had variable access to economic opportunity. Yet the natural parenting movement today is more diverse than ever, and cuts across distinctions of religion, region, race and class in ways that its media depiction would appear to underreport. My paper considers how women themselves have represented the natural parenting movement to one another. Using an archive of online message boards and blogs focusing on natural parenting, as well as more traditional archival sources, I explore how women communicated about the natural and the authentic; how they built businesses (including companies that made baby carriers or cloth diapers) to support their beliefs; and how they reached out to other women, both to educate others and to promote their own interests. </p>","Attached At The Hip: Natural Parenting From The 1950s To The Present"

To what did Augusta, a city of 10,000, owe this distinction? The answer was its booming publishing trade. Home to E.C. Allen & Company, Vickery & Hill, and others, Augusta was the source of millions of cheap periodicals dispatched across North America each month and the indisputable capital of the United States mail-order-magazine trade. This idiosyncratic industry fell somewhere between the worlds of Richard Sears and Cyrus Curtis, yet differed greatly from them in ways that complicate our understanding of how industrially-produced culture fit into a nascent consumer society. For Allen and his peers, the goal was not to sell subscriptions or even advertising space, but to recruit direct-sales agents who could be persuaded to purchase bulk lots of cheap goods – lithographs, telescopes, photograph albums, and other items – imported from abroad. Along with these premiums, Augustas publishers were prodigious importers of paper, ink, envelopes, and other key commodities – perhaps the most important of which were the mailing lists they used to find those Americans most likely to succumb to their appeals. The payoff was a steady stream of coins, money-orders, postage stamps, and other makeshift forms of payment that made their way to Augusta each day. This nexus of junk mail, cookie-cutter magazines, cheap goods, and small payments produced a kind of mass-culture boom town that by centurys end had run its course. </p>","Augusta, Maine, Mail-Order Magazines, And The Political Economy Of Junk In Gilded Age America "

Sponsoring Kiram as a special international student was part of a larger colonial experiment aimed to train her to become a leader and broker of civilization in her Moro [Muslim] Filipino community. The experiment tried to carefully manage her tutelage in the United States so that she would be Americanized just enough so as to lift her out of the so-called barbarism of cultural practices like polygamy and yet retain enough of her cultural background as a Moro to maintain a connection to her community. This presentation investigates the kinds of techniques executed in the colonial experiment on Kiram. It looks at how a range of seemingly disparate elements like chaperonage, curriculum, grading, spending allowance, leisure, modes of dress and adornment were weaponized as forms of surveillance and management. It also analyzes how American public created a sensationalized form of surveillance that sought to measure the colonial experiments success and failure through observations of Tarhatas changing physical and sartorial aesthetics.</p>","Balancing Cultures In Colonial Experiments: Tarhata Kiram And Disciplining Muslim Filipino Identities"

Because basketry is a gendered labor, women are placed at the center of this record. Women are often left out of the historical record in California, yet through basketry we can resurface these voices, look at how Native women used them in a multitude of ways for example as legal documents, or literature, fashion, spirituality, etc.  These baskets are rooted in land specific territories, their designs originate from landscapes, and this knowledge is passed down from generations.

For the Zuni, by stark contrast, Zammouri was a harbinger of conquest and colonial violence, and is memorialized as Chakwaina, the black monster kachina.  From the Native perspective, whether a White European or an enslaved Moroccan, Zammouri represents the beginning of a long and violent history of colonization that continues to the present day.  For Arab and African Americans, Zammouris position as a Black/African/Arab/Muslim/Slave and non-European is essential to the story.  These opposing narratives speak to issues of race, power, and colonialism then and now.  Zammouris changing racial identity illuminates Arab American racialization and racial in-betweenness; if early twentieth-century Syrian Americans were positioned somewhere between Arab and White, today, Arab Americans have drifted demonstrably toward the dark end of the racial spectrum.</p>","Between Arab And Black: Zammouri, Race, And Arab American Identity"

Consequently, the historiography obscures the roles of adolescent black girls, particularly those who were not on what is deemed to be the front lines of the movement. I contend that looking beyond classrooms and marches expands our definition of civil rights activism, and reveals the various, and lesser-known, ways that black girls engaged with the movement. Histories that examine alternative frontiers of civil rights activism, such as recreation, focus primarily on heterosocial spaces, and do not employ age as a category of analysis. In contrast, I focus on two single-sex organizations and their programs for adolescent girls: the National Association of Colored Girls 1960 Citizenship Institute for Future Leaders and the National Council of Negro Womens 1965 International Debutante Cotillion. How did membership in an organization facilitate black girls abilities to participate in social movements and provide a platform for them to discuss their ideas? In what ways did black girls symbolize the fulfillment of civil rights? The Institute educated young black women about government and citizenship, but also emboldened and provided a platform for them to articulate their thoughts about civil rights protest, and make claims for economic justice. Debutantes from around the world gathered at the International Debutante Cotillion to symbolize the promise of integration and democracy at home and abroad.

Branded as &quot;The Town that Freedom Built&quot; and marketed to heritage tourists as the &quot;Oldest Incorporated African American Municipality in America,&quot; Eatonville has inspired generations seeking refuge from despairing tales of life in the Jim Crow South at &quot;the Nadir&quot; of race relations in America. The town&quot;s longstanding narrative, rooted in late 19th century promotional literature and popularized by the autobiographical works of Zora Neale Hurston, exaggerates and romanticizes separatism while ignoring Eatonville&quot;s vital place within a booming regional economy. The broad appeal of this origin myth, celebrating black political autonomy as a solution to &quot;The Great Race Problem,&quot; is based on the mistaken belief that blacks in Central Florida -- like other regions of the South -- were routinely excluded from participation in local politics and civic affairs. In fact, African American voters played a crucial role in the incorporation of Maitland and Winter Park, historically &quot;white&quot; towns that border Eatonville. Two African Americans sat on the Winter Park Town Council, and an African American edited the Winter Park newspaper. Freedom Built These Towns as well, yet no signs or monuments commemorate this brief but successful era of biracial governance and civic engagement at the dawn of Jim Crow Era. This paper will propose a new interpretive strategy that better accounts for the formal establishment of black towns and settlements throughout the region, and better integrates Eatonville into that broader regional narrative. </p>","Beyond Zora's Eatonville: Black Labor, White Capital, And The Neo-Abolitionist Origins Of Central Florida's Model Townships"

The young, single soldiers who comprised the armed forces flocked to see these women and applauded their efforts to bring a bit of home front femininity to the war zone.  But as the volunteer force took shape in the early 1970s, military families became a more integral part of military life and culture.  This shift in demographics produced a new focus on family programming within military welfare and morale organizations.  Although women remain a fixture of popular USO shows on bases in Bagram and Kandahar, wartime entertainers now include characters like Big Bird and Elmo who also do their part to maintain the morale of military families in the United States.  Todays recreation programs are designed not only for single enlisted servicemen, but also for single mothers, military families, and military children.  As the U.S. military continues to expand the roles of uniformed women (many of whom are mothers) and continues to rely on military families to bear the burdens of service, morale-building entertainment work serves as one important connection between the armed forces and American society.  The juxtaposition of sexualized women and childrens cartoon characters to build morale signals the complex and contradictory ways that military and civilian officials collaborate to provide for the needs of a diverse force of men, women, and children stationed across the United States and the world. </p>","Big Bird In Camouflage: Entertaining Military Families In The Modern Military"

The next day he went to the polls to vote. He was turned away. Historians have noted Wisconsinites defiance of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law and highlighted the Republican Partys commitment to black suffrage. Wisconsin Republicans were among the most progressive in the country. Yet, the efforts of antislavery and abolitionist Wisconsinites failed to alter the political marginality that black Wisconsinites faced in the founding decades of the state. Gillespie filed suit against election officials claiming black suffrage had been approved in 1849. The election officials claimed that their actions were lawful because blacks did not have the right of suffrage. In 1849, 5,265 white voters said yes to black suffrage, while 4,075 white voters voted no. However, 31,759 votes had been casted in the general election; so, 22,419 voters chose not to vote on black suffrage at all. The State Board of Canvassers concluded that because a majority of voters did not support the referendum black men could not vote in state of Wisconsin. In 1866, Gillespie appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court and won. A wrongly interpreted technicality kept black men in Wisconsin from the ballot box for seventeen years. Moreover, racism and prejudice among the early settlers of Wisconsin had pushed black people to the political margins. </p>","Black Suffrage And Settlement In Wisconsin"

As Bryant pushed her way onto the Los Angeles jazz scene in the 1940s and 50s she had to prove herself to those who claimed that a trumpet is a mans instrument.  After years of documenting the musician&quot;s life, Davis faced important questions about the form this biography would take. How would she, as a filmmaker, address the complexities and nuances of Clora Bryants life? How did Bryants version of her life story differ from the version Davis would tell? Rather than do a biography on Sojourner Truth, Davis decided to take a different approach and examine a few key moments in her life.  Most people think that Truth said the words, Arent I a woman? In recent years, however, historians have documented that Truth did not say those words, but Truth took the advantage and allowed others to think that she did. Why did she do this? Since Truth is not around to be interviewed, as a filmmaker I have to take a different approach to exploring this question.    Where do you draw the line between myth and truth?  What strategies were used by Bryant and Truth so that they could have some control over their stories and their image?

The hardening of the border that followed the U.S. Canada Boundary Commission of the 1870s did not, however, terminate the cross border movement of Blackfoot bands.  Families visited each other across the line, band members registered on rolls in the U.S. and Canada, and Indian agents fulminated against Blackfoot manipulation of fluid, yet contradictory notions of status, blood, and citizenship.  The international and reservation boundaries as stipulated in Treaties with the Blackfeet circumscribed Indigenous lives and narrowed their options, but Blackfoot bands maintained a surprising degree of movement throughout their homelands.  Following the Blackfoot encapsulates themes associated with the intersections of Indigenous histories and histories of nation-states, particularly their competing notions of law and (il)legality.  The collision of Blackfoot sovereignty and the formation of borders created fluid conceptualizations of citizenship and highly complicated—if not contradictory—discourse over race and racial boundaries.  The projection of nation-state, reservation, and reserve boundaries failed to extinguish Indigenous defined territories that transcended international borders and the legal regimes associated with them.  Although the systems of surveillance sought to galvanize the gaze of the state as it colonized Blackfoot bodies and identities, they proved incapable of caging and containing those same subjectivities as they manipulated the shifting spaces of status, citizenship, blood quantum, and tribal/band identity.</p>","Bloodlines And Boundary Lines: Blackfoot Bands And Families Along The U.S.-Canada Border, 1870-1915"

Jack Dougherty and contributors are creating On The Line: How Schooling, Housing, and Civil Rights Shaped Hartford and its Suburbs (http://OnTheLine.trincoll.edu), a publicly accessible book-in-progress under contract with Amherst College Press.On The Line tells the story of schooling and housing boundaries that shaped American metropolitan life over the past century, and also the civil rights struggles of families and activists to cross over, redraw, or erase these powerful lines. Set in the city of Hartford, Connecticut, and its emerging suburbs, the book explains how this metropolitan area became one of the most racially and economically polarized regions in the northeastern United States. The story highlights how government, business, and white middle-class families drew lines to distance themselves from others, and the evolving coalitions that have sought to reform the relationship between private housing and public education. This digital-first book was designed for the open web. The narrative is wrapped around digital evidence—including interactive maps, videos, and documents—to make hidden boundaries more visible, and to amplify the voices of people who challenged these lines. Also, in an open-access book, history becomes more widely available to the public, without barriers of price or permissions. As educators, we believe that knowledge becomes more valuable when it is easily discoverable and accessible, not hidden behind password-protected paywalls. Moreover, the liberating power of history—and civil rights history in particular—should be freely available, especially for the communities of people who lived these stories. On The Line seeks to blend the best aspects of conventional publishing and web innovation. The main narrative still looks and feels like a scholarly book, divided into chapters and backed up by endnotes. But the web platform allows us to embed digital evidence on the page, and to link directly to external resources located elsewhere. As a result, this book delivers a more comprehensive, coherent, and connected work of scholarship than what was previously possible in print-only publications, or scattered online journal articles and blog posts, at no cost to the reader.For historians considering their own digital book projects, this paper will raise issues and offer resources on the following questions:What different types of narratives about race and education can be told in digital books?How does web publishing change our thinking about access, authorship, and preservation of the past?What possibilities for publication exist today in the spectrum from traditional print-only to digital formats, and hybrid models in between?</p>","Building On The Line: An Open-Access Book On Housing And Schooling In Metropolitan Hartford, Connecticut"

This essay thinks through the particular silences engendered by post World War II urban restructuring in the form of federal urban renewal, private urban development and gentrification of working class neighborhoods, all of which result in the mass displacement of vulnerable populations.

By 1962 the Golden State was the largest in the Union. With this dynamic increase in population came a similar surge in the Roman Catholic population of California. Today, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles counts nearly 4 million Catholics within its boundaries. The Diocese of Orange alone, consisting of a single county, has over 1 million  Catholics.In 1945 there were 5 Roman Catholic dioceses in the state. Today there are 12. Catholics are over 30 percent of California&quot;s population. The Church represents the diversity of California&quot;s population served by ethnic parishes and institutions. It also has a present in the equally diverse geographical regions of the state. Catholic hospitals, schools, and agencies of social provision continue to play an enormous role in the state.

Or, it was portrayed as a harsh regime forced on spiritually weak and vulnerable women, their souls and bodies held captive. Celibacy was the waste of a human life—the grave of the heart, as one 1846 anti-Shaker pamphleteer put it. Such popular portrayals ran contrary to the lived experiences of Shakers and Catholic women religious in the antebellum era. Shaker spiritual autobiographies, manuscript records from Catholic orders, and songs and psalms show that the sexual and spiritual choices of these women were the product of deliberate intention, rather than coercion or accident. Celibacy and chastity, sexual identities based on abstinence, were identities to the Shakers and Catholics who embraced these ideals. Individuals practicing sexual abstinence or limitation saw themselves as distinctly different from those who did not.  Yet unlike modern-day sexual identities which are often justified by a born-this-way biological imperative, celibate individuals prided themselves on the unnaturalness of their restraint.  In this sense, the subjects of this study understood desire to be what we would consider to be socially constructed.The divide between a Protestant middle-class print culture and private community records points to antebellum Americans narrow conceptions of young womens spirituality and agency, as well as the threat celibacy posed to white middle-class understandings of womanhood and sexual virtue. </p>","Celibacy, Choice, And Coercion:  The Sexual Identities Of Catholic Nuns And Shaker Sisters 1790-1860"

An untold number of Natives died from this terrible disease on their forced removals west.  This paper investigates this tragedy through the lens of Indigenous medicine.  It argues that Native peoples experience with cholera would have been much less severe had they been allowed to stay in their homelands and attend to public health on their own terms, but U.S. officials—including President Andrew Jackson—knowingly subjected thousands of Natives to the health hazards of removal and thus allowed an American medical tragedy to happen.</p>","Cholera And The Trail Of Tears: An American Medical Tragedy, 1831-1834"

Yet surviving accounts of African American religious life in the early years of Reconstruction were written almost exclusively by white observers, whether northern missionary teachers or white southerners still hostile to emancipation. These two groups of white Christians, one believing the Bible had supported slavery and the other long committed to antislavery, remained vehemently opposed one another, but they shared certain assumptions that they alone could steer free people toward the proper religious beliefs and practice. Both justified their actions through biblical stories and theological ideas, and to different degrees, both ignored black Christians desire for independence and self-determination.This paper explores the methodological challenges of telling the story of the creation of independent black churches in the post-emancipation South from an archive full of white voices. It demonstrates strategies for reading against the intention of white writers to learn about freed peoples religious lives and work, their collective goals, and their organizing activities. Disputes over biblical interpretation, worship forms, and political alliances illumine the strategies that African American Christians employed to define their religious and political independence. Among these competing communities, Christian identity became a synecdoche for those who belonged and deserved civil and political rights in the post-emancipation United States. As groups across lines of race and politics articulated what good Christian behavior entailed, they drew lines of inclusion and exclusion around American identity during Reconstruction. </p>","Christian Citizenship: Archives Of Religion, Race, And Belonging In The Post- Emancipation South"

Evidence exists that local planning commissions understood that racial zoning maps were unconstitutional but wished to build city plans around them nonetheless, including the location of segregated schools.  They encouraged school boards to place new schools in either racially restricted white suburbs or in increasingly isolated black ghettos while neglecting mixed-race areas.  Thus, school building programs during the 1920s substantially increased the distance between black and white schools, and as a consequence, between black and white homes.  It was not until the end of the decade that city planners recognized that school sites were one of the most powerful tools at their disposal, which at least partially explains why schools, despite their importance, have often been missing from the narrative of residential segregation.  Since school site selection rarely presented a significant challenge to city planners, they never felt the need to advocate for it as strongly or as overtly as more controversial tactics such as zoning.  School boards seldom resisted the recommendations of planning commissions and never to the extent that city councils opposed strict zoning laws.  Moreover, battles over school sites rarely landed in the courtroom, unlike the endless challenges to zoning restrictions.  As a result, planners acquired significant control over school construction before fully recognizing that they had already found a quick, legal, and effective strategy to enforce unofficial racial zoning maps.</p>","City Planners And The Use Of School Sites To Impose Racial Zoning On Southern Cities Before 1930"

Twenty-five weeks into her pregnancy, her cancer returned and metastasized.  Her prognosis was terminal and her condition dire. When George Washington University Hospital administrators learned that Carder was days from death and without a plan to save her fetus, they went to court to determine their responsibility to her pregnancy.  Against the wishes of her family, the court ordered the baby delivered immediately via cesarean section.  Born at twenty-six and a half weeks, the baby lived just two hours. Carder died two days later.  Carders case was one of about three dozen cases in the 1980s in which hospitals and doctors went to court to force pregnant women to undergo cesarean sections in order to preserve the life and/or health of their fetuses. Using archival records, legal decisions, medical and popular literature, this paper argues that claims of fetal personhood existed outside of the realm of abortion politics in the 1980s, even as both sides drew up on Roe v.

It tracks the rationales employed by lawyers, policymakers, and pregnant women both to claim and refute fetal personhood and links them to contemporary medical advances and cultural norms.  It also outlines the ways in which court ordered cesareans reshaped the doctor-patient relationship and contributed to public debates about the legal status of the fetus and of womens rights in pregnancy.</p>","Claiming And Refuting Fetal Personhood In American Maternity Care, 1979-1990"

Little Liberia was originally established by elite members of the Los Angeles Black community, but later involved Blacks from across the United States and Canada.  The colonys original goal was to become an agricultural source for California.  By economically influencing the United States from outside its boundaries and prejudiced social systems, Little Liberia&quot;s leaders intended to alter White American&quot;s perceptions of African Americans and therefore enact social change.  These African Americans proposed to transcend existing cultural and political barriers in the United States and Mexico through cooperation between different races and across borders.  Little Liberia would use the United States-Mexico border as a buffer for United States racial animosity, but also allow economic and social ties to flow across that same border.  Little Liberias founders strove to provide a place where both Blacks and Mexicans could come together to enact cross-border change white simultaneously keeping ties across the border back to Los Angeles.  The colonists constantly crossed the border to visit Los Angeles in order to keep community ties.  The unique racial landscape of Los Angeles and the American West played a pivotal role in establishing this relationship.    However, international politics occasionally barred them from crossing back into Baja California, and eventually played a role in the colonys end ten years later.  Little Liberia&quot;s colonists strove to simultaneously create a thriving community that was integrated into the Baja California landscape and use the colony&quot;s proximity to the border to enact social change.  The colony, however, eventually succumbed to pressures from international politics, economic struggles, and mismanagement which led its eventual close. This paper will not only discuss the history of Little Liberia, a relatively unknown community, but will also tie together African American and Borderlands histories by looking at the overlapping role both of these topics played in the colonys aspirations and activities.  To do this, this paper brings in foundational elements of Black Studies and Border histories, including the importance of imaginaries and story-telling.  Rather than reading a paper, this presentation will be presented as a story with analysis woven into the narrative in order to engage the listener while simultaneously modeling the importance of the communitys story in its history.  Advertisements, editorial letters, and stories from community members appeared in Black newspapers in Los Angeles and later in Black newspapers and magazines throughout the country.  These pieces are pivotal for understanding the dreams and aspirations of this community, as well as the larger African American community at this time.

The story of Indian removal and the subsequent incursion of non-Indians into Indian Territory has long been told and appropriately characterized as a story of colonialism.  This essay expands upon that story by considering how law, lawyers, and the legal system in this uniquely designated place aided and facilitated non-Indians in taking possession of natural resources and how, in response, native people used the law to empower themselves and retain coal resources.  The Choctaws provide a case study of Native Americans who both suffered from the introduction of an alien legal regime and wielded significant influence by adapting to the law and hiring lawyers who sometimes exploited them and at other times effectively fought for and protected their interests.  Law and capitalism worked together in a borderlands region and empowered settlers to exploit indigenous people and their resources.  Conversely, law and capitalism presented a new forum that some indigenous people learned and embraced in order to reap new economic opportunities and empower themselves.  </p>","Coal And Capitalism: Law In Indian Territory"

It created global circuits of people, skills and products which brought economic, social, and demographic transformations to coffee-producing colonies. By focusing on Hawaii and Taiwan, this paper explores how coffee production became part of the imperial projects before WWII. Although Hawaii and Taiwan were under the control of different empires—Hawaii under the US empire and Taiwan under the Japanese empire—Japanese migrants constituted a predominant population on both islands. More significantly, some of those who were involved in the production and business of coffee in Hawaii contributed to Taiwans coffee production before WWII. This Hawaii-Taiwan connection established and activated by Japanese diasporas, and through which people, coffee plants and production skills were transplanted, cannot be overlooked for two reasons: First, it highlights the significance of the Asia-Pacific region in the history of coffee production. Since coffee history has been examined predominantly from a Euro-centered perspective, the incorporation of the Asia-Pacific region into its examination allows us to delineate the influences of coffee as an imperial commodity in a larger context. Second, this connection shows the importance of Japanese migrants as agents of the transportation of coffee plants and production skills from a colony of one empire to a colony of the other. This diasporic connection indicates the complexity of networks that crisscrossed the Pacific. </p>","Coffee Production In The Asia-Pacific: The Circulation Of Japanese People, Coffee Plants And Production Skills Before WWII"

But before this could occur, civic elites embarked upon a campaign to improve the image of the city to discourage surrounding communities from seeking independent incorporation.

The rise of a parallel set of nonprofit organizations, known as intermediaries, directly facilitated this maturation through the packaging and leveraging of private investment for low-income neighborhoods. Sometimes chartered by state legislatures or neighborhood residents, other times initiated by corporate leaders or philanthropists, and always structured as nonprofit organizations, these intermediaries sought to yoke neighborhood improvement to capital markets through strategies of asset acquisition, debt financing, and tax syndication. This paper explores the history of community development in Boston during the 1970s and 1980s to argue that the rise of financial language and tools in the social sector emerged as much from grassroots activists needing access to capital as it did from elites looking for new ways to deploy their wealth for charitable purposes. By claiming to have proved that low-income housing could produce both a financial profit for investors and a neighborhood benefit, Boston intermediaries helped accelerate the larger embrace of market-oriented funding strategies in the philanthropic and nonprofit sectors. That these new funding mechanisms continued to include the state as a financial partner and source of legitimacy also reveals how the financialization of social welfare developed not as a rejection of the states role, but a redefinition of it. </p>","Community Development And The Rise Of Nonprofit Financing Intermediaries"

Recently, a hormonal birth control shot developed for men received a lot of media attention because studies conducted in 2011 and 2012 showed that it was (perhaps) associated with an increase in depression and sterility in some men. The serious side effects of hormonal birth control for women include stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolisms, an increased risk of developing certain cancers, and depression. By comparison, hormonal birth control seems much safer for men than for women. It is important to alert everyone to the possible health risks associated with hormonal birth control, but the amount of media coverage the comparatively mild side-effects pose to men is not proportionate to actual risk, which is small. The inverse is true for women. Women who take hormonal birth control (potentially) risk their lives, but the Pill is often portrayed as a safe method for preventing pregnancy (and early warnings by activists like Barbara Seaman who published, The Doctors Case Against the Pill (1969) did not receive enough attention).   This paper explores these asymmetric standards by analyzing the social environment in which hormonal birth control for women was developed and approved for use (1940-1960s), particularly the tensions that emerged between feminist groups who supported the Pill because it gave women greater control over sexual freedom and family planning and the researchers who warned of the deleterious side-effects of hormonal birth control. Focusing on these tensions will uncover some of the reasons why taking hormonal birth control despite the risk became a sign of freedom for women. Iconic feminist activists like Margaret Sanger and Mary Ware Dennett campaigned for hormonal birth control, and Katharine McCormick funded much of the Pills research and development. The Pill not only represented a form of birth control, but also an important moment for feminists: the ability to prevent pregnancy could free women to enjoy sex without worrying about unplanned pregnancy, to pursue careers, and to have more control over the size and timing of their families.          I argue that while the social benefits of the pill tremendously benefited women, they eclipsed the health risks associated with the pill. Even today, critics of the pills health risks often face hostility from feminists who associate criticism of the pill with criticism of social progress. Separating the social and the medical aspects of the Pill allows us to rethink hormonal birth control without inadvertently attacking feminism and positive social change for women. This approach invites more fruitful discussion of viable alternative methods of birth control for both men and women. Making birth control a human issue rather than a feminist issue might also finally end the disparity in perceived costs and benefits of taking hormonal birth control, making its use safe and more widespread in both women and men.  </p>","Controversial Contraceptives: Uncoupling The Pill And Social Progress To Assess Risk  "

Staffed by a small but dedicated group of volunteer doctors, lawyers, hippies, and housewives, the LAFC was originally viewed as a problematic addition to the Fairfax neighborhood in Los Angeles, and was perceived as a place for drug addicts, transients, and promiscuous teenagers to gather. Others expressed concern that staff, including doctors, were handing out LSD and marijuana to patients. By the early 1970s, however, the LAFC found itself a welcome and legitimized part of the Los Angeles County health care system, working closely with the LA County health department, an organization that had tried to shut down the clinic just a few years earlier, and lauded by local media and city government.  This paper argues that this shift in perception occurred in part due to alliances made between the staff of the LAFC and local government officials who gradually began to give support to the fledgling, and sometimes floundering, organization. These alliances allowed for the open exchange of ideas, as both sides worked toward a similar goal: to provide aid to the citys disadvantaged. The creation of these alliances allowed the LAFC to flourish and grow, and brought a sense of legitimacy and respectability to this anti-Establishment health care center.  Likewise, the local health department began implementing ideas from the LAFC in their creation of new county health clinics, creating a seemingly mutually beneficial period of cooperation between Counterculture and Establishment.</p>","Counterculture Versus Establishment: Health Care And Cooperation In 1970s Los Angeles"

She wed her belief in the universal brotherhood of humanity to the socialist economic theories and pacifism that had gotten her partner arrested and blackballed from academia by 1919. While often hidden behind her husbands public persona, her publishing from 1950 through 1995 and public talks skillfully translated dense radical theory and spiritual philosophy to advance respect for all life. Helen Nearings thought developed from presenting plants and rocks as natural resources for human consumption to a larger focus on the personhood of all living beings and subjecthood of seemingly insentient natural phenomena—a conceptual shift with serious implications for human interactions with the rest of the world. She represents a longer history of American religious and anti-capitalist dissidence that has valued equality, liberty, freedom from want, and personal growth despite roots in imperialist capitalist colonization.</p>","Cultivating Humaneness By Grafting Together Natural Science And Spirituality"

A third generation Japanese American from Hawaii, she was described as pretty and pert by media sources that raved about her beauty and requested that she perform hula.  Stories about Minks political achievements as well as her exotic status as an Asian woman from the Pacific Islands circulated both nationally and internationally as part of U.S. Cold War cultural diplomacy.  This presentation analyzes how these depictions of Mink interpreted her historic political achievement through normative discourses.  I also examine how Mink navigated these expectations as she lobbied for progressive agendas that challenged U.S. Cold War militarism. Asian American history during the Cold War has received more attention in recent years.  The scholarship of Cindy I-Fen Cheng, Ellen Wu, and Madeline Hsu reveal how the racialization of Asian Americans was shaped by U.S. international and domestic agendas concerning decolonization and civil rights.  Gender was central to this changing racialization of Asian Americans.  The efforts by Asian Americans to integrate into white suburbs and the emergence of the model minority discourse, which represents Asian Americans as having strong nuclear families, illustrate how gender normativity has buttressed claims for racial inclusion.  My proposed presentation will utilize intersectional approaches to analyze the political career of Patsy Mink. She challenged racial, gender, and regional barriers to become a U.S. Congresswoman, but her achievements were contained within Cold War normative discourses.  </p>","Dancing Hula In Congress: Patsy T.

Yet Hearst reached a far larger audience in the following decades, as he built up a chain of over twenty papers, mostly based in smaller cities such as Syracuse, Oakland, and San Antonio.  Through the 1910s and 1920s, Hearst papers were rarely an immediate success.  In fact, each time the chain took over a local newspaper, stuffing it full of bland editorials, mass-produced features, and news by wire, that paper lost thousands of readers.  Yet Hearst found that by adding very limited local news and features, often fitted into a template shared by all of his papers, he could satisfy his readers desire for local information and make his newspapers a viable, profitable enterprise.  Hearsts early sensational news tactics and his attempted political career have received more attention than the everyday workings of his newspaper chain.  This paper argues, however, that the business model of the Hearst chain is perhaps Hearsts most lasting news legacy.  Historians have sometimes described the coming of mass market capitalism as the local losing out to the national: the corner store succumbing to the Sears catalog, the local weekly ceding to the Saturday Evening Post.  Hearsts newspapers, though, straddled the local and the national.  This tactic created mass media that could thrive in a local context.</p>","Delivering Local News Via Mass Media: The Hearst Newspaper Chain, 1910-1930"

Whereas elite British Indians had once pursued higher education mostly in the colonial metropole, England, by the end of the century, middle- and upper-class Indians and Pakistanis opted for the universities in the United States. This transformation was, most obviously the result of new legislation, namely the Immigration and Nationality Act (1965). This paper demonstrates, however, that it was through careful planning and concerted effort, that the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Information Agency put American higher education on the radar of South Asian students well before passage of the 1965 act. The Cold War-era programs of the American state drew the United States sharply into the consciousness of tens of thousands of Indians and Pakistanis. In addition to sending South Asians to the United States through passage of the Fulbright Act (1946) and Smith-Mundt Act (1948), the State Department and USIS exhausted every opportunity to send American lecturers, exchange professors, performers, and athletes to hundreds of schools, colleges and universities throughout India and Pakistan. They held education workshops, arranged for consultations with American educators, hosted lectures on the merits of American education, and even facilitated the college application process. As a result, the United States emerged as the prime destination for higher education. While some experienced the United States personally, others learned about American education secondhand, but both groups spread word in their own family and social circles. </p>","Democracy University Vs.

The ROC Agricultural Technical Missions were nominally technical cooperation projects, but in actuality a joint effort at public diplomacy by the US and ROC.  In fear that Albanian-led efforts to replace the ROCs seat in the United Nations with the Peoples Republic of China would gain a supermajority of votes, the US secretly funded ROC missions in the hopes that they would buy votes among newly decolonizing nations of the Third World. By 1971, the ROC had expanded these missions to over two dozen countries across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.This paper will discuss the emergence of development as a space for public diplomacy during the Cold War.  Specifically, it examines how development became an ideological battleground for the hearts and minds of the Global South.  United States planners believed that Taiwanese missions to the Global South would bolster its own development credentials since it touted Taiwan as a graduate of two decades of US development aid.  Taiwanese diplomats traded technical expertise and development projects in exchange for votes in the UN, but simultaneously utilized the rhetoric of technical aid as international and domestic propaganda.  Demonstrations of Taiwanese expertise abroad, showcasing the superiority of Taiwanese techniques, generated nationalistic sentiments at home that helped legitimize the regime.</p>","Development Diplomacy In The Cold War: Taiwan And Us Development Missions To Vietnam And Africa, 1959-1971"

The series was ultimately produced in Mexico City, in collaboration with the Taller de Gràfica Popular or TGP (The Workshop for Popular Graphic Art) an internationalist artist collective. At the time, TGP artists were producing a series of prints representing the history of the Mexican Revolution, Estampas de La Revolucion Mexicana. In resonating styles and themes, the Estampas series and Catletts Negro Woman both depict heroic figures alongside everyday scenes of joy, fear, sorrow, rage, and struggle. While Estampas narrates the history of the Mexican Revolution as culminating in a war against fascism, Catletts series culminates in the scene of a lynching. Proceeding from this instructive juxtaposition, this paper considers Elizabeth Catletts role in Black internationalist feminist history. It argues that I am the Negro Woman offers an under-interrogated example of how graphic art can systematize Black radical history, to use Cedric J. Robinson apt phrase. In recovering the transnational spaces of the series production, it also recuperates under-explored internationalist responses to fascism. Towards this end, the paper considers the forms of international solidarity present in art collectives organized during the Great Depression and the early years of the Second World War, all while plotting the circulation between these spaces. These artists approached representational struggles against lynching, racial violence, capitalism, and fascism, while theorizing the linkages between them in the process.</p>","Disrespecting Borders: Elizabeth Catlett, Internationalist Art Collectives, And The Mexican Revolution "

The tour marked the culmination of an effort that spanned Clintons presidency to promote private sector investment and access to loans and capital as the main route to addressing poverty and inequality in distressed communities. This tour provides a point of departure for exploring the ethos of doing well by doing good and Clinton and the New Democrats vision of public-private partnership. This paper will highlight the particular role of third sector institutions and foundations in that equation that ultimately gave rise to the objectives of Clintons own post-presidency foundation. Examining these policies in closer detail also provide a means to interrogate the complexity and spectrum of ideas about government, the market and private sector since the 1970s. It also provides a means to probe the development of a Democratic and liberal version of neoliberalism, and the role of foundations in fostering it, which has come to shape many of the prevailing ideas about markets and private investment as a tool to address to poverty and social inequality. </p>","Doing Well By Doing Good: Public-Private Partnerships From Clintons Presidency To Clinton Foundation"

Mexicos North (exemplified in this paper by Coahuila) was a particularly besieged territory, and one that Mexicans desperately hoped to hold. In an effort to settle this area with loyal citizens, a number of interesting projects arose to bring Coahuila, a key Northern Mexican state, under Mexicos control in the 1850s. Military colonies were one option tested out by the Mexican government. So too was the project of the so-called Immigrant Tribes (Tribus Emigradas). The immigrant tribes were invited to Mexico and consisted of Black Creeks, Seminoles, and Kickapoos. Mexican officers in the North imagined these newcomers would take up arms in defense of their adopted patria. But what looked like a convergence of interests to Mexican officials represented something quite different to the Indians invited to settle Mexico. The Immigrant Tribes imagined their settlement on the Southwest border as a sort of independent pan-Indian colony outside of the purview of both Mexico and the United States. This imagined quasi-autonomous Native territorial entity ultimately floundered by the early 1860s. The reasons for this were various, but most importantly independent Indians and Mexicans found that they had very different visions for the areas future. Mexican vecinos and officials alike realized that the Indians had no intention of assimilating. Instead, they hoped to carve out their own territory in northern Coahuila.</p>","Dueling Futurities: Independent Indians And Mexicans In Coahuila, 1848-1861 "

A number of women told their senator about their problems with household matters.

Mrs. Helen Sprigs explained that she could not afford orange juice, even though it was good for her children.  Mrs. Harrison Duffy complained that her children were going without cod liver oil (presumably the children were not overly upset by this).

Placing the device on a desk, Edison turned a crank on its side and the machine inquired as to our health, asked how we liked the phonograph, informed us that it was very well, and bid us a cordial good night.  The words chosen to describe this, the first record-listening party, are evocative. The machine speaks. It asks after its interlocutors health (affirming its own,) sounds their opinions and issues a valediction on its own behalf.

This paper explores the relationship between oral history and performance in research on racialized women who traveled on nightclub circuits during the Cold War. Scholars have explored how the U.S. used official cultural diplomacy to craft an image as a benevolent racial democracy. Less explored, however, is how performers also traveled on nightclub circuits fulfilling a commercial demand for a desirable racial other. To access the stage, performers had to be legible within racialized and sexualized tropes such as the geisha and the dancing Latina. Yet in oral histories with these performers there has been a noticeable silence about race – at least in words.Analyzing oral histories with dancers Dorothy Toy and Teresa Champion, this paper argues that both women used the live body to critique and reimagine the American mythology of racial democracy. Oral history consists of narration and performance. As Toy and Champion narrated their careers, they made use of gesture, an impromptu step, or the humming of a tune to bring past performances to life. They described, but also embodied how they had used dance to engage critically with the past during the Cold War. Through choreography, costume, and genre they reworked the racial tropes into which their audiences placed them.  Toy and Champion should be regarded as skillful storytellers using dance to engage with the past.

Like African American working-class women generally under Jim Crow, African American blueswomen in the era of the blues recording boom of the 1920s struggled under race, class, and gender oppression, both within the public and private spheres of everyday life. Gertrude Ma Rainey, who fronted The Assassinators of the Blues, and Bessie Smith, The Empress of the Blues, among others, expressed a defiant alternative consciousness in the emergent radical form The Blues, and flaunted a defiant alternative lifestyle in their commercial personae and activities. Blueswomen challenged dominant cultural norms of femininity, patriarchy, domesticity, heterosexuality, and the modern capitalist work ethic.

Centred on the Nile Valley, this paper argues that the American engineering diaspora was the key protagonist connecting the United States to empires across the world at the turn of the twentieth century. Using British colonial and American business archives, this paper explores collaborative Anglo-American engineering projects in Uganda and the Sudan as a specific form of inter-imperial connectivity and examines how historical actors themselves imagined and managed patterns of long-distance connection. To do so, it focusses on bridge-building projects in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and in the British East Africa Protectorate undertaken by American firms.The paper proposes a framework of global connectivity defined by inter-imperial interaction as one solution to navigating the tensions between imperial and global history. Inter-imperial projects often took the form of industrial sub-contracting, were collaborative in nature, and were organized by non-state actors and institutions. Central to the management of these inter-imperial relationships were networks of American engineers and experts who mediated the transfer of ideas, expertise, and technology across and between empires. At once both collaborative and competitive, the framework of inter-imperialism recaptures the mutual influences that shaped Empires and opens up the analytical ground for historians of the United States in the world to think across national, regional, imperial, and global scales of space.</p>","Engineering The Scramble For Africa: American Engineers And Histories Of The United States In The World"

Directed especially at ethnic Mexican and subsequently also Filipino populations, the repatriation drives of the 1930s reflected the extent to which the contemporary crisis of capitalism was also a crisis for prevailing terms of social order, citizenship, and belonging.  My paper explores grassroots responses to repatriation in the context of 1930s California in order to illuminate how those targeted by repatriation constructed notions of identity and belonging for themselves, against those that dominated national discourses of citizenship.  Drawing on sources that include archival records, newspapers, corridos and other forms of cultural production, I shed light on the daily struggles, decision-making practices, modes of cultural production and political organizing engaged by targeted populations in their efforts to navigate the world around them in the age of repatriation. I call attention to currents of transnational belonging that crystallized at the grassroots and consider how those currents combined imperatives for civil rights with transnational and global visions of social justice.  Moreover, I reflect on their implications for broader understandings of working-class politics in the age of the Depression and New Deal.</p>","Envisioning Belonging In The Age Of Expulsion: Grassroots Responses To Repatriation In 1930s California"

As you might imagine, Richmond found his petition to himself to be quite persuasive.  It was framed in the language of the poor law, making a case that the Providence overseers of the poor start warning out people who failed the towns tests of moral character and ability to support themselves.  The petition used the language of the poor law so fluently that it could only have been written by an overseer of the poor.  But the petition went beyond previous recommendations to the overseers of the poor by arguing that vagabond blacks should be the chief object of the overseers warnings out.  The petition asked that the overseers use what had been a color-blind law in ways that were anything but colorblind.  The overseers happily complied, beginning periodic roundups of the black community that lasted more than two decades in Providence.  Richmonds 1806 petition to himself was perhaps the most explicit use of the poor laws to justify ethnic cleansing in early republican Providence.  In practice, though, overseers around the North used colorblind poor laws as tools of ethnic cleansing repeatedly.  This paper will highlight a handful of the most provocative primary sources connecting the poor laws to race in Rhode Island.  The author will argue that municipal power was one of the most immediate and overpowering avenues through which people of color encountered white supremacy in the North.    </p>","Ethnic Cleansing With Poor Laws: Cases From Early Republican Rhode Island"

As the Jewish family members and friends scattered to three continents, they sought to remain in contact with those left behind and others who shared a life in exile, particularly the new constellation of family members developing in the United States. Yet the writers inability to assist one another led to an extreme degree of self-censorship. Hiding marital abuse, life-threatening illness, and wartime peril meant saving correspondents from worry and despair. Letters to others, diaries, and oral histories make clear the lengths to which these correspondents went in order to spare one another emotional pain. At the same time, expressing love and concern, joy, and satisfied monotony could sustain their ties and make it through censorship as correspondence became more difficult in wartime. People in a variety of relationships—lovers, siblings, parents and children, former roommates and friends—made decisions about which emotions to write. They did this within the emotional landscape of their times and places, but also in the context of wartime disruptions and extensive migrations. By examining this collection in light of which emotional content people expressed, this paper takes up the call by scholars of migration such as Hasia Diner and David Gerber along with scholars of emotion such as Peter Stearns.

A few months later at the inaugural meeting of the United Nations, the delegate from India declared that the growing tide of racism spreading throughout America and other parts of the world presented a problem more serious than war between nations. In post-war America, these fears were personified by the actions of Theodore Bilbo who advocated the open use of violence against people of color who attempted to vote in that summer&quot;s Democratic primary.This paper builds on the work of Carol Anderson, Penny Von Eschen, Mary Dudziak, and others who have examined Americas political and racial climate in the post-war period on the global stage. It adds to the conversation of these scholars by foregrounding the important role Bilbos election played in shaping the ideology of modern conservatism both domestically and abroad after the war and extending the traditional timeline of the rise of conservative politics in America held by scholars such as Elizabeth Fones-Wolf and Joseph Crespino. Perhaps most importantly, Bilbo&quot;s Senate campaign illuminates the deep connective tissues that bind race, conservatism, and Cold War geopolitics in the mid-twentieth century. Using Bilbos election as a prism through which to view the roots of conservatism allows scholars to more accurately understand the rise of veiled racial rhetoric and how it has come to be a staple of neoliberal political discourse in the present. </p>","Fearing Bilboism In Bangalore: Race, Citizenship, And The Rise Of Global Conservatism, 1946-1948"

Using the Vietnam war as portrayed in the novel The Things They Carried by Tim OBrien as its starting point, faculty members asked students to examine various accounts of warfare----Hollywood films, comedic skits, television shows, popular music, social media etc.----and juxtapose those fictionalized accounts against the politics of what really happened. To ascertain the truth about warfare, students conducted and examined oral histories with real soldiers who fought in Vietnam and the various present-day Gulf conflicts. Students then examined primary documents---such as soldiers letters, newspaper accounts, speeches from politicians from the 1960s to present day, and various media outlets---to decipher inconsistencies between the reality and perception of warfare. Lastly, students were asked to discuss the role of fake news and fiction in creating the historical record and the problems this creates for the historian and the public at large.OBrien, a former journalist turned novelist, was a perfect individual to use as a framework to understand the tenuous connection between politics, entertainment, reality, perception, fact and fiction. This paper includes a description of how the project was structured, details the various types of entertainment students examined, and provides survey results from students regarding the use of fact and fiction to understand warfare. In addition, four students had an extended conversation with the project faculty regarding their experiences with the novel, popular culture, the media, their own experiences as soldiers, and the project itself; their stories are shared in the paper.  Finally, the paper discusses the faculty members perceptions of the projects outcomes, including the use of alternative assessments (non-traditional essay assignments, multi-media presentations, etc.) for students to present and support a thesis regarding the role of entertainment in the historical record.</p>","Fiction V Facts:  Juxtaposing The Media, Hollywood, And Oral Histories To Uncover The Truth Behind Warfare"

Fifty years ago, Kings dream for racial-economic justice, labor rights, and peace came together during his Poor Peoples Campaign and the black sanitation workers strike in Memphis, Tennessee. On March 18, 1968, King rallied black workers, students, and teachers for a general strike. Had the strike been successful and had King lived, this would have opened up a new labor and civil rights alliance that King called the second phase of the black freedom movement, the struggle for economic equality. Instead, despite the rise of black political power, right-wing Republican legislators overturned majority-black Shelby County minimum wage increases, a unified school taxing district, and union rights. Memphis developed the highest poverty rate of any city of its size. Through oral history, film clips, and music, this presentations asks how should we remember King? Drawing on his film, Love and Solidarity, and his current book project, Kings Unfinished Agenda, Honey links nonviolence history to present-day organizing, civil rights unionism, and immigrant rights, with Kings unfinished agenda for union rights, economic equality, and an end to racism, poverty, and war. </p>","Fifty Years Since Memphis: Fighting For Kings Unfinished Agenda"

Beginning in 1947, the Philippine-Ryukyus Command (PHILRYCOM), a subordinate command under the authority of the Commander-in-Chief of the Far East (CINCFE), recruited Filipinos for employment in the construction, operation, and maintenance of military installations on Okinawa. In addition to Filipinos, the U.S. military employed Ryukyuan laborers, natives of Okinawa, who had been forced out of agricultural work by the war and occupation—of the nearly 75,000 Okinawans who labored for the US military, 80% had been driven out from the rural communities through land expropriations. Furthering structuring a labor market increasingly defined by U.S. policy, the military and military contractors employed flexible racial categories to determine wages. In practice, this meant that imported labor, largely Filipinos, earned higher wages than their Ryukyuan counterparts. US occupation officials responded to local protests regarding wage inequality by promising to phase out the use of foreign workers. These efforts, however, were not simply responses to Ryukyuan labor protests. Instead, the creation of English language and technical training courses for Ryukyuan laborers and eventually the forcible repatriation of Filipino laborers from Okinawa were part of broader Pacific-wide system. I argue that the circulation of low-wage labor reproduced an imperial system based on deep wage inequalities, revealing how the geographical expansion of U.S. national security and U.S. capital were mutually constituted in the early postwar period.</p>","Filipino Laborers And The U.S. Military Post WW II"

They focused less upon the present need philanthropic dollars might fulfill and more on the future these resources might endow, through aggregation, investment, and imagined eternal growth. In this way, American Jews contributed crucially to the financialization of American-Jewish philanthropy, of American philanthropy, and of the American public. American Jews worked in concert with multiple groups—from other religious and ethnic collective entities to large nonprofit stakeholders—and responded to economic, political, and cultural forces not of their own making, while, nonetheless, playing a pivotal role the financialization of American philanthropic practice. Their aspirations for modern Jewish life were inseparable from their commitments to American progress through the growth of free markets, decentralized economic opportunities, and pluralistic politics, all managed by a state that nourished non-statist means of power through financial practices. Even as American historians over the last decade have turned their attention to the American state and, especially, its relationship to capitalist expansion, few have given more than a passing nod to philanthropy. Yet massive transformations in philanthropic practice and rhetoric after World War II served as profound pathways for the expansion of market logic into new spheres of American life, including domestic and international policy and intimate matters of identity, spirituality, and community. </p>","Financialized Philanthropy And The American-Jewish Philanthropic Complex"

This study relies on archival research, oral histories, and legal analysis to understand the five distinctive waves of repatriation and banishment that included voluntary, coerced, and forced removals during the following periods: 1831-1892, 1921-1923, 1929-1933, 1934-1938, and 1939-1944. The numerical records of removals during the Mexican Repatriation drives are staggering, scholars and governmental agencies, however, disagree on an exact number. Estimates usually range from a low 400,000 to a high 2,000,000. There are numerous factors contributing to the different estimates. For instance, some only report the numbers on official federal deportation records; while others call attention to the fact that repatriations were conducted by local agencies and thus left no trace on federal statistical records. Additionally, distinction between forced, voluntary, and coerced departures are not always clear resulting in diverse estimates. Moreover, studies and archival records rarely differentiate between banishment and repatriation as Mexicans were grouped for removal without consideration to their legal status. The different set of years under consideration adds to the disputes because some studies only include the decade of the 1930s, others only the first four years of that decade, but there were different waves of repatriation and banishment ranging from 1831 to 1944. Examining the similarities and differences between each removal wave helps us understand the particular experiences of each cohort and the difference in prolonged consequences across generations.</p>","Five Repatriation & Banishment Waves: Rethinking The Mexican Repatriation Program"

The island group includes the most-populated Chichi Jima and arguably the most famous Iwo Jima, although the latter was excluded from the World Heritage Site since it is a military base.  What makes the Bonins unique, however, is not just their nature but also their unprecedented transnational history.  The Bonin islanders, consisting of variety of race and ethnic groups from all over the world, have been deeply affected by the Pacific War and the Cold War, which divided the peoples.  Moreover, for former Iwo Jima islanders, the Cold War has not ended since they are not yet allowed to return to their home due to the military use of the island.This presentation aims to introduce the history of the Bonin islands and their peoples in the context of U.S.-Japan relations as well as its historiography.  There are two main questions to be answered.  The first is why Bonin Islanders were racially divided and forced to be refugees during the Cold War era.  The second is why former Iwo Jima islanders have not yet been allowed to go back to their home island while other Bonin Islanders were all allowed to live on the islands where they were from.  To explore this matter, U.S.-Japan imbalanced security relations after World War II and U.S. nuclear strategy in the Far East are also discussed.  The presentation is based mainly on diplomatic documents from national archives in both the U.S. and Japan, interview records of the islanders, and Japans latest Iwo Jima policy that is studied from the official reports of the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare as well as newly passed law regarding the problem of collection war remains in Iwo Jima.</p>","Forgotten People Of Iwo Jima: A Study On The Post-World War II History Of Iwo Jima Islanders In The Context Of The U.S.-Japan Security Relations"

It focuses on Frank Rizzo—Philadelphias controversial police commissioner-turned mayor—and his white, blue-collar supporters. Rizzo was a quintessential backlash politician. While recent scholarship has overturned the long-dominant backlash narrative that formerly characterized the rise of the modern right, it still dominates treatments of urban and working-class antiliberalism. This paper complicates the story of urban, working-class backlash. It argues that the rise of blue-collar conservatism represented a populist variant of modern American politics that did not immediately abandon welfare liberalism. To the contrary, this paper shows how it derived from the mutually reinforcing promotion of law and order conservatism and the selective rejection of liberalism. Explaining how structural and cultural forces within the city and nation created a powerful sense of blue-collar class privilege, it also illustrates how blue-collar whites used their class identities to obfuscate discourses of racial privilege and challenge urban liberalism. By relocating the narrative in the spatial politics of the urban North, this work challenges studies that view modern conservatism as an exclusive product of suburban communities in the South and West. Northeastern working-class urbanites brought complementary but different motivations to movement conservatism. I argue that the inclusion of blue-collar conservatism in the history of Americas right turn is essential for understanding not only changes in urban working class politics, but also the broader history of modern conservatism. </p>","Frank Rizzos Philadelphia And The Rise Of Blue-Collar Conservatism"

Foreclosures and unemployment destroyed lives and bred despair, leading to desperate rural protests.  Iowa led the nation in bank failures from 1921 to 1931, with an average of 87 banks failing each year.  It also had the largest total mortgage debt in the country—more than twice any other state.  Desperate unemployed women in Des Moines turned to prostitution to survive, charging from one to three dollars for sex.  Families burned corn to stay warm over the winter, as they did not have the money for fuel.  A barter economy dominated rural parts of the state, as people exchanged food and clothing to survive.

Uniting gay and lesbian, Chicana/o, labor, African American, and feminist organizations, the coalition spearheaded a sustained boycott of Coors beer. Boycotters targeted the Coors Brewing Company and family for anti-unionism, discriminatory employment practices, and conservative politics. Many heralded the boycott as unique, powerful, and political. Ten years later, it was over. The now-nationwide boycott of Coors beer formally came to a close in 1987, after Coors signed agreements with the NAACP, AFL-CIO, and other organizations to that effect. These settlements also reflected the fragmentation of the boycott coalition. So what happened? Histories of cross-racial, inter-organizational alliances in the long civil rights era have been the subject of innovative and ground-breaking scholarly work over the past decade. Much of this literature, however, focuses on the long 1960s. This paper, examining the trajectory of the Coors boycott coalition, will bring this conversation into the 1980s. It argues that Reagan-era economic policies and corporate strategy, rather than internal disagreements, fragmented the coalition. Activists pragmatically, if reluctantly, accepted financial support from Coors in return for a pledge to end their boycott. In conclusion, this paper, by examining the strange career of the boycott coalition, will shed new light on processes of collaboration and disunity, offering the boycott as a cautionary tale for activists and coalitions today.</p>","From Boycott To Buyouts: The Rise And Fall Of The Coors Boycott Coalition In The 1980s"

I investigate the change from within the academy—at the School of Criticism and Theory and by the Theory and History of Literature book series—and from outside the academy—Critical Theory trading cards, witty and playful books like Plato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar…, and various cartoon introductions to French Theory. These diverse enterprises helped to produce consumers of theory and to create the empire of theory in America during the last three decades of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century. By embracing theories that enlarged the scope of critical exercises to a universal practice of thought, these theory enterprises and their consumers advanced the neoliberal mission to foster efficient knowledge transfer. Beyond historicizing this phenomenon, my paper also contemplates reasons why this new mode of theory was so well received. One possible explanation is that, because philosophy as a way of life had been deemphasized in American philosophy departments, literature departments took up the mantel of theory as a way of life. Meanwhile, for the American public, the above enterprises met the demand. Consumers of theory sought philosophical-spiritual self-examination and found it—accessible, affordable, and palatable. </p>","From Critical Schools To Trading Cards And Cartoons: Producers Of Theory And Their Spiritual Consumers"

Moral reformers and abolitionists organized these institutions purportedly to rescue poor, enslaved, and immigrant women from sexual trafficking by shuttling them instead to domestic workplaces. But despite framing paid domestic labor as a rescue from prostitution and slavery, the matrons who extracted housework from their inmates engendered similar forms of commodification: public inspection of workers bodies, geographic displacement, family separation, and sexual exploitation. Matrons positioned themselves as the rightful proprietors of feminized labor during the very creation of a wage-based labor market by contrasting themselves with the madams of brothels. Workers, including madams, resisted such treatment in various ways but faced unexpected constraints. By the late 1830s, matrons had developed new partnerships with the state through corporate charters and municipal police laws. The consequences of displacing nineteenth-century sex workers—of forcing them to move from brothels to asylums, from bedrooms to kitchens—were manifold. This process of displacement eroded womens safety within sexual commerce by diminishing toleration of urban brothels. Perhaps its most troubling long-term effect, however, was to authorize the rise of a deeply gendered, racialized, and undervalued market in care work. From Madams to Matrons reveals the early American roots of coerced domestic labor during the period of gradual emancipation in the North. The institutions and discourses formed during this period later shaped the well-documented labor politics of the Reconstruction South and recent care-workers movements.</p>","From Madams To Matrons: Sex Work And Domestic Labor In The Northern United States, 1790-1848"

Rather than performing pedagogical or didactic interpretation in the manner of costumed tour guides, living history practitioners were learning agricultural and culinary skills, studying the beliefs and backgrounds of their subjects, and, most importantly, living and interacting with audiences as denizens of the past. By the middle of the decade, more established institutions like the Smithsonian and the National Park Service were experimenting with living history programming, although the practice was met with controversy from other professional corners.What is less studied are the reasons for such a surge, and the individual motivations and assumptions that nascent living history practitioners were bringing to these efforts. My paper will examine these early cohorts of living history practitioners, focusing specifically on the ways in which certain aspects of countercultural practice (commune living, individuated experience, handicraft) informed the ways in which living history practitioners, many who came from academic history backgrounds, were forming this new interpretive field. </p>","From The Commune To The Museum: The Counterculture And Living History In The 1970s."

Where does this image come from? Is this the image the Marine Corps maintains from within its ranks? This paper argues that the answer to these questions is far more complex than the stereotype might lead one to believe. I examined a sample of issues of the Marine Corps newsletter, Leatherneck, from the 1920s to the 1990s to investigate the presentation of Marine bodies in its pages, noting how the expression of masculinity and femininity on the body changed through time, as well as how it remained stable. I contrast this sample with images of Marines from Time, a mainstream news magazine aimed at a middle-class American audience. This comparison shows change and continuity in the perception of the Marine body and Marine gender through time. Aaron Belkin argues that masculinity and femininity intertwine in military environments, and R.W. Connells Masculinities and Judith Halberstams Female Masculinity point to the variety of gender expression, supporting my argument in favor of a more fluid definition of military gendering. Challenging the stereotype of the Marine as the epitome of masculinity raises further questions about the equal treatment of male and female Marines into the contemporary era. Understanding the nuances of gender within the Marine Corps will lead to increased equality for all Marines in the future.</p>","Gender Expression And The Body: Images Of Marines From Leatherneck And Time"

In addition to images of the leading players of the period, photographs of relatively unknown burlesque actresses, ballet dancers and other female performers were produced for commercial circulation. Sheet music of sentimental songs suitable for the middle-class parlor sometimes featured variety and burlesque actresses with whom the song was associated. Men in middle-class households could also possess less respectable images of the same women, because less decent images of these actresses were circulated by photographers, the actresses themselves, and via advertising placed in the pages of men&quot;s sporting newspapers. Beginning with images that appeared on sheet music suitable for parlor performance, I will examine a number of images of burlesque and variety actresses active during the 1870s and 1880s in order to explore the ways that sexualized images that were the exclusive province of men co-existed with, and could be intensified by, images of the same actresses that were safe for a middle-class family setting. I will also examine the ways that performance details, including musical features and performance context, complicate assumptions about the appeal these women held for the men in their audiences as well as prevailing assumptions about the performance skills possessed by these women. This more nuanced view allows us to see differences between working-class and higher-class audiences more clearly, as well as locating the shared desires of American men regardless of class.</p>","Gendered Knowledge: Commercial Photographic Images Of Actresses And The Production Of Desire"

It highlights the potential and limits of the multiracial coalitions of the 1970s and 1980s and the turn to electoral politics as the primary vehicle of African American empowerment 100 years after it was first tried. Scholars and journalists routinely attribute Washingtons electoral triumph and brief success as mayor to personal charisma, the rise of independent black political power, and the Democratic machines leadership vacuum after the death of Mayor Richard J. Daley. While all true, this framing too often narrates Washingtons story as exceptional to Chicago rather than one increasingly illustrative of national political trends. By looking at both long-term development of neighborhood coalitions around worker rights, housing, community-police relations, and economic development, I argue that the Washington moment and movement reflected two countervailing forces that shaped urban politics for a generation, and in certain ways echoed a previous politics from the 19th century: a real but fragile black political empowerment consistently hemmed in by shifting economic forces, violence, and white political opposition. One clear difference was the political empowerment of Latinos as part of the Washington moment.</p>","Harold Washington: The Black Mayor In A Balkanized City"

The story forms a poignant example of inter-imperial exchange and learning between the colonial tropics of the American and Japanese empires.  This paper uses a food commodity as a way to illuminate complex entanglements of U.S. and Japanese tropical colonialisms with a focus on the agency of Hawaiis Japanese as indispensable brokers.  After the mid-1920s, a handful of immigrant intermediaries facilitated the transfer of knowledge and technique of modern pineapple farming and canning by re-migrating from Americas insular territory to Japans island colony.  These resettlers were self-styled frontier farmers, who viewed the conquest of unexploited land—whether in the United States or in imperial Japan—as being connected to what they described overseas Japanese/racial development.  Having been inspired by U.S. discourse on frontier development, they had maintained psychic and material connections to colonialist endeavors of their homeland as much as they had been committed to the American frontier myth.  And for that very reason, it was not a farfetched proposition for them to re-migrate from Hawaii to Taiwan when circumstances called for such a move.  Following U.S. immigration exclusion of 1924, American racism and invitations by Japans colonial regime/capital served as catalysts to the return migration of these immigrant pineapple experts to the home empire, as they came to feel white-dominated Hawaii no longer offered possibilities for their racial development. </p>","Hawaiis Japanese Immigrants And An Origin Of Colonial Taiwans Pineapple Industry"

This paper contributes a valuable perspective from the global South to the emerging field of gendered histories of the Cold War and the impact of public diplomacy. At the same time, by paying special attention to East Pakistan (known as Bangladesh since independence in 1971), this paper complicates the nationalist narratives and nation-state-centric narratives of both Pakistan and Bangladesh. While histories of Pakistan have tended to privilege what was then West Pakistan, histories of Bangladesh have tended to work within a linear and teleological nationalist narrative that, with the exception of a few recent projects, has ignored the Pakistan era of 1947-1971. The paper draws on the archives of the relevant US organizations as well as cultural, social, and political archives from East Pakistan—such as periodicals, memoirs, and development and activist organization literature, and oral histories. The result is a more nuanced picture of the encounters between women from the United States and East Pakistan, who are more fully situated in the larger national and transnational contexts within which they wrote and struggled for change. </p>","Helping Women Take Their Rightful Place In The World: Us-Pakistan Encounters During The Cold War"

Although manufacturers first imagined Puerto Rico as a consumer market, they realized it had a tradition of fine needlework that was quickly appropriated for the purposes of industry.  Enterprises in that national industry already functioned as components of a global operation and recognized Puerto Rican needleworkers as a pool of skilled labor easily calibrated to their fluctuating needs.  In the early 1900s, Puerto Rican needleworkers labored at piecework in homes and sweatshops on the island and also migrated to the mainland where they labored in various ways in northeastern factories, sweatshops, and mills.From the 1920s to the 1970s, U.S. agencies, Puerto Rican government offices on the island and mainland, and textile and garment enterprises collaborated to recruit and distribute Puerto Rican needleworkers throughout the Northeast.  Older northeastern factories and mills hired Puerto Rican women workers, who constituted much of the labor until closures in the late-1980s.  During those decades, Puerto Rican women participated in the migrations, created their own chains of communication and support, and joined unions.  At the same time, the State Department used Puerto Rico as an example of export-oriented industrialization for Third World countries.  Despite a dominant historical narrative of straightforward relocation and deindustrialization, this paper exposes a much more complex history.Contrary to popular understandings of American capitalism, enterprises did not relocate in a direct line from North to South to Global South, nor did they propel an advancement of wages and work conditions.  Diverse labor practices existed simultaneously, providing enterprises with a catalogue of options for their ongoing reconfigurations.  Connecting the history of Puerto Rican needleworkers to the larger history of the textile and garment industry revises the historiography and makes visible both the women workers and mechanisms of global capitalism.  In this approach, capitalism functions as an ever-changing mesh rather than as a progressive economic system.  The mesh involves strands of shipping, migration, information and technology, finance, raw material extraction, ports, banks, manufacturing, and border controls.  Enterprises and laborers navigate those fluctuating strands and respond to changing trade agreements, environmental and labor regulations, technologies, and currencies. Common conceptual and historiographical divisions between womens, labor, U.S., and Caribbean histories have obscured the connections Puerto Rican needleworkers have with older northeastern factories and mills.  Historians have missed evidence vital to understanding the intensification of neoliberal political and economic projects during the late-twentieth century.  Those neoliberal projects relied not only on abstract theories from economists like Friedrich von Hayek and the Mont Pelerin Society, but also on the pragmatic scaffolding of policies and practices developed with Puerto Rican needleworkers. U.S. government and corporate experiments with sovereignty, citizenship, offshore manufacturing, insular exemptions, and the managed migrations of Puerto Rican women fostered that scaffolding.</p>","Homework, Sweatshops, Factories, And Mills: Puerto Rican Needleworkers And A Deep History Of Neoliberalism"

If as Dorothy Hamer Denniston notes--that in Black literature, it is the imagery of architecture [that] especially cements the novel together— then the ways in which the architecture of the home conceals and silences its inhabitants is a useful metaphor for thinking of the design of public housing and tenement buildings as well as the kinds of physical and nonphysical injuries that packing bodies into tight spaces have also caused.

It is true that the thousands of young people who flocked to Haight Ashbury and Greenwich Village in the 1960s were overwhelmingly white. As one black observer asked, How many black hippies do you see? This paper relies principally on black publications (Ebony, Jet, Freedomways, the Chigago Defender) to argue that the counterculture, Civil Rights movement, and Black Power intersected at many junctures. True, some black nationalists despised hippies, and some hippies could not fathom the Civil Rights movements desire for inclusion in a society they claimed to reject. But the black freedom struggle powerfully influenced the cultural upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s, and blacks played a significant role in it. As historian Sherry Smith perceptively observes in her study of hippies and American Indians, the social and political movements of the 1960s and 1970s were very much intercultural and interracial. A detailed examination of the affinities and tensions between hippies and blacks, and between the counterculture and black culture, reveals a varied and complicated relationship. There was no single countercultural position on racial issues, and no single black response to the counterculture. White hippies exhibited a wide range of attitudes toward other cultures and races, ranging from an overwhelming faith in love and universal human brotherhood and sisterhood to outright racism. Hippies chose to become outsiders from society, and so imagined that they shared some commonality with black Americans. On the other hand, because they dropped out of American society, many hippies scoffed at the Civil Rights movements effort to gain inclusion in the mainstream of American life. Blacks responses to the counterculture also ranged from contempt to outright embrace. Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. urged Americans to pay attention to the hippies alienation and endorsed their belief in the power of love. Some black nationalists reviled the counterculture, but other considered vital in the effort to topple the Establishment. Stokely Carmichael dismissed hippies as affluent dilettantes who would soon return to the confines of middle-class life, but Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver hailed the hippies cultural rebellion as more vital than the New Lefts political challenge to the System. African-American culture, style, and especially music were all affected by the countercultures innovation and experimentalism. If few blacks became tie-dyed, sandal-wearing hippies, many black Americans embraced some elements of the countercultures styles and values. Drug use, new fashions, and the psychedelic soul and funk music of Sly Stone and George Clinton all contributed to what might be termed a black counterculture.</p>","How Many Black Hippies Do You See?

The Hungarian governments attempts at restriction went hand-in-hand with other efforts to keep migrants loyal while they are in the United States. The government also sought to profit financially from the migration that it did allow. These three methods of migration management were all intertwined, and all extremely controversial.

This search for resources in the Amazon during the nineteenth century became a common practice by countries such as the United States that saw an opportunity in the recent independence of Latin American countries to establish economic and political relationships with these new nations. The northern Upper Amazon region of Peru was identified as an area that had many resources to offer to these trade-oriented countries. The narratives from these scientific expeditions coming from the United States reflect the travelers perceptions about what the Amazon could offer to their own countries future political and economic interests. On one hand, the Amazon region awakened the interest of world powers as a potential source of raw materials, but access to the resources and the people relied upon the rivers. On the other hand, the Peruvian state encouraged the outsiders exploration of the Amazon and its resources in order to attract foreign immigration, technological knowledge, and external investment. In both situations, political elites expected to gain something by identifying the opportunities inherent in the Amazon. Although the narratives display much about the Upper Amazon as a landscape ripe for commodification, this paper aims to transcend that analysis and examine this particular part of the Amazon region itself. </p>","In Search Of Botanical Resources: Encounters Of American Scientific Expeditions With The Peruvian Upper Amazon During The Nineteenth Century "

Schools had long been the most important Catholic institutions in Black urban communities. Inner city parochial schools increasingly faced closure in the 1970s as the white Catholics who once supported them continued to move to the suburbs, fleeing Black migrants and enticed by federal subsidies. Catholic dioceses ostensibly faced the dilemma of whether Catholic money should be used to educate non-Catholic children. But the NOBC recognized a racially coded dimension in this diagnosis. When Catholic officials say that there will be Catholic schools where parishes can pay for them, the statement noted, they are stating obliquely that there will be Catholic schools in the white community. Black Catholics criticized what they took to be the Churchs divestment from Black communities and simultaneous investment in white ones. This paper will focus on conflicts between white and Black Catholics over schooling in 1970s. It will seek to illuminate the lived religious experiences on both sides of this debate – Black Catholics who argued that the gospel called on the Church to educate the impoverished regardless of their religious affiliation as well as white Catholics who fiercely resisted attempts by dioceses to do so.

But in the mid-19th century United States, social transformations including urbanization and industrialization contributed to an increase in the popularity of treatments that purported to harness the esoteric and natural qualities of Indian medicine. From patent medicine advertisements to home health manuals, Indian images, names, and likenesses abounded. One aspect of this phenomenon that has received little scholarly attention is the rise of Indian doctresses as a professional class. These Native and non-Native women capitalized on shifting popular cultural understandings of race and gender to heal or counsel others and to make a living. Many Indian doctresses specialized in providing gynecological or obstetric care (including abortions), while others provided a full range of medical services, treating chronic ailments and serious diseases, or worked as fortune tellers. Although they were a part of the broader botanic medicine movement, this paper argues that particular perceptions about Native women contributed to the rise of Indian doctresses as urban entrepreneurs in the 19th-century United States. The study uses newspapers, reform literature, and criminal records to highlight notable Indian doctresses in the 1840s-1870s and examine the intersection of popular cultural ideas about indigenous womanhood and mid-century trends in medicine and social reform. In so doing, it contributes to both the history of medicine, which has focused largely on formally trained women doctors rather than irregular practitioners, and labor history, which still too often ignores Native people.</p>","Irregular Women: Indian Doctresses And American Medicine, 1840-1880"

Historians have seen her fantastic success in the realm of contraception and abortion as paradigmatic of the commercialization of sex in the middle decades of that century. Her notoriety also made her a target for reformers like Anthony Comstock, who ultimately proved to be her undoing. While Restell was arrested numerous times and spent more than a year in jail for the crime of abortion (after New York had criminalized it), she was also the subject of rumors and investigations for a variety of other crimes, kidnapping and child murder among them. In 1846, for instance, Mary Applegate accused her of delivering her child and then promptly taking it from her, never to be returned. In this paper, I take up the these stories to argue that in order better to understand the outrage over abortion, we must focus on the growing sacralization of childhood in the nineteenth century. The kidnapping rumors served to highlight understandings of abortion as the termination of a potential childs life. Restell also symbolized what supposedly went wrong when young girls were allowed freedom and independence in a growing metropolis: they were sexually exploited. Parental authority was undermined when irregulars like Restell provided what seemed like an easy solution to unwed pregnancy. In short, using the lens of childhood this paper offers a new way of understanding the outrage over abortion in the mid-nineteenth century.</p>","Kidnapping, Child Murder, And The Notorious Madame Restell"

A leader in this effort was George Ballis, an activist and photographer from the Central Valley.As editor of the Valley Labor Citizen newspaper, Ballis documented the plight of migrant farmworkers, and was credited with helping to bring Chavez to national attention. Ballis led the National Land for People Movement in a water war against corporate farms, believing that while unionization for farmworkers was worthwhile, ultimately the balance of power remained unequal. Ballis saw water reclamation as a way of alleviating the poverty and suffering of migrant farmworkers and restoring the balance of power. Through breaking up large landholdings and redistributing them (along with the water rights) to the people who worked the land, Ballis envisioned radical realignment that addressed issues of food security in a way that contemporary critics of food deserts have all but ignored.In many ways the current water crisis in California has its roots in the failed dream of Ballis and the National Land for People Movement. The NLP has received scant attention from historians and is often treated as a curious, even utopian attempt to stave off water-hungry corporate farms. I suggest, however, that NLP provided the most realistic solution to Californias problem with agribusiness and that the movements failure ultimately turned the tide in favor of large-scale corporate farms. </p>","Land, Food Security, And Water Rights In The Central Valley: George Ballis And The National Land For People Movement"

A Welsh émigré, Evans was a geographer who traversed North America in order to produce a map, a map that would go on to be one of the most widely circulated images of the eighteenth century. A General Map of the British Middle Colonies, published in 1755, was the culmination of several years of work for Evans and his collaborator, Thomas Pownall. Their efforts, initially focused on producing cartographic works to assist in the French and Indian War, steadily evolved into a commercial and political production. A General Map and its companion essays were unique in their attentiveness to representing indigenous sovereignty, while also providing the first record of petroleum. Yet what this map also did was claim a copyright.In this paper I argue that A General Map was the first copyright in America. While the current scholarship importantly notes that literary property was not considered legitimate in the colonies – only an English person on English soil could claim it – Evans sought to copyright his map in Philadelphia. While A General Map was one of the most pirated texts of the late colonial period, Evans efforts, decades before the first recognized copyright in 1782, were a deliberate political move to protect the representation of his work. The copyright debate surrounding A General Map was pivotal in early national attention to intellectual property, particularly in the passage of the first comprehensive law in 1790.</p>","Lewis Evans, Copyright, And The Creation Of Borders In Early America"

In 1977, Betsy Beaven, Selma Miriam, Samm Stockwell, and Pat Shea—the Bloodroot Collective—opened Bloodroot feminist restaurant and bookstore in Bridgeport, Connecticut. From their strictly vegetarian menu to their communal operations, the Collective intended to live out their lesbian feminist ethics daily. McGrath examines the Bloodroot Collective and the oppositional lives they cultivated inside their experimental establishment. The Bloodroots history is the history of late-twentieth-century radical lesbian feminism in action. That narrative contains the mid-century awakening of a group of white middle-class women, who rejected social convention for the counter-normative unknown. It contains radical feminisms 1970s-1980s apex, when Bloodroot restaurant was part of a national network of creativity and intense communalism. It contains the down-right exhaustion inherent to living ideologically. It also contains turn-of-the-twenty-first-century challenges, by women of color and queer and transgender critics, to the house that lesbian feminism built. She concludes that woman-centered organizations like Bloodroot, while politically limited, preserved oppositionality and cultural innovation in the post-Sixties era.

These efforts to enact residential segregation were relatively unsuccessful; the state Supreme Court nullified the Winston ordinance a few years after its passage, and the Senate voted against the rural segregation amendment.  This paper explores how North Carolinians came up with the notion of segregating neighborhoods by race.  It investigates why some people thought to apply the idea of segregating public space to private residences.  It looks, too, at residential segregation laws in other states and other countries (such as South Africa), which proved inspirational to segregationists in North Carolina.  This paper ties on-the-ground residential segregationist efforts in the state to a larger movement on the part of segregationists around the globe.  At the same time, it looks at what was specific to the state, including the fact that small white farmers there were able to assert their interests against those of the planter class, a rare occurrence after the defeat of the Populist Party.  Residential segregation in N.C.—in both Winston and the countryside—was not supported by the states elites, who thought that this type of segregation would make it harder for them to access the black workers whose labor they relied on.</p>","Local, Regional, And Global Influences On Residential Segregation Laws In North Carolina"

This process masked U.S. complicity in the overthrow of Hawaiis sovereign government and ignored the protests of its people by claiming the monarchical government, school system, and local society originated from American missionary influence. As such, U.S. educators sought to craft a commonplace attitude of Americanization as a naturally beneficial and inevitable result of progress. Thus, Hawaiis past was not the product of Native Hawaiian agency but the result of Americas benevolent civilizing mission.This process of legitimization relied on the belief in American progressivist exceptionalism that presumed the superiority and universal applicability of Euro-American ways over indigenous cultures. The promotion of this America-centric narrative erased Native involvement in Hawaiis past by revising and elevating American involvement to that of paternal benevolence. It also dismissed and suppressed the opposition of local groups to educators plans of constructing a national identity by labeling them as old, backward-looking, and un-American. Accomplishing this required prioritizing universal American principles of democracy, citizenship, and the English language in local schools in order to establish dominance over the specific interests of parents, students, and their community. This helped create a simplified standard of identity dismissive of alternative social and cultural realities and necessary for promoting national unity and public cohesion.Essential to spreading and naturalizing this narrative was the public school system. Schools represented efficient and effective sites for transmitting and exposing students to schoolmens standardized historical message of what made Hawaii American. This benevolence however did not exist in a vacuum. Alongside their idealism, white educators imported and inserted American attitudes on race into the school system and recreated the very conditions of inequality and structures of school segregation they claimed to reject. Thus the process of democratizing also led to the racializing of Hawaii.Despite this paradox, white schoolmen remained unfazed. In speeches, articles, and pamphlets examined from 1900 to 1940, they preached their obsessive belief in the inherent Americanness of Hawaii. They also broadcasted to the nation and territory the same message used by U.S. imperialists justifying territorial annexation: that Hawaiis American character was not an accident but part of the deliberate genius of American leadership. To affirm this view, this paper argues white educators implemented a complex educational strategy blending continental attitudes on race, Americanization, and citizenship to produce a campaign of erasure affirming Hawaii was, and always had been, American. Their pedagogical crusade intended to justify American occupation and control of the islands by constructing and disseminating a consistent and convincing narrative that repackaged clear examples of Hawaiis independent indigenous past as products of Americas benevolence and commitment to progress. Hawaii was always destined to become American; its people just did not know it yet. </p>","Making Hawaii American: Race, Citizenship, And Americanization In The Public Schools Of Territorial Hawaii, 1898-1941"

Scholars, whether taking a positive or negative view of the resultant Dominion of New England, have consistently viewed it as a brief era centralization later undone by political events across the Atlantic. This paper examines Andros land policy in Maine, which involved using maps as administrative tools, to suggest that such centralization actually unfolded at a plodding pace. Moreover, it depended upon local intermediaries who used their connections to the surveyor to acquire land and consolidate their own power in town politics. In other words, centralization paradoxically strengthened certain kinds of parochial powers. At the same time that Andros hoped to use maps to delineate boundaries between landholders, he also used them to mark boundaries between the English and French in America. In examining a corpus of petitions, deeds, correspondence, and maps, I show that this moment of boundary making and contestation ultimately contributed to revolt and warfare—rebuking the interpretation that these events had their genesis in Europe. Finally, this paper considers how archives have organized and preserved these maps in ways that shape how scholars can interpret them—in a broader sense helping us to understand why opposing interpretations of the Dominion have both adopted the same set of incorrect assumptions.</p>","Maps, Petitions, And Boundaries During The Dominion Of New England, 1686-89"

Repatriation involved a number of U.S. citizens, who accompanied their spouse or parents to Mexico, and in the subsequent years, families sought to establish their citizenship status. Their return to the U.S. along with their new families often depended on such proof. Uniform system of birth registry was not widespread in the early 20th century, and lack or insufficiency of documentary evidence was first of the obstacles for many former repatriates.  Some faced additional hardship in meeting citizenship requirements and deadlines.  Especially for boys and men, as the U.S. entered World War II, registration for military services was crucial.  For those who reached draft age, failure to register or absence from the U.S. lead to questioning of their U.S. citizenship.         Citizenship troubles not only concerned the U.S.-born repatriates but also their Mexican-born children entitled to U.S. citizenship under jus sanguinis rule.  Acquisition and retention of jus sanguinis citizenship, however, was far more difficult than jus soli citizenship. Citizen-parents sex, and residency requirement of the parents for passing on U.S. citizenship and of the children for retaining their U.S. citizenship were some of the key conditions that families had to fulfill and prove.

Notably, as New Deal historians have pointed out, the FLSA included occupational bans that excluded African Americans, women, and poor whites from its protections. The law also banned child labor nationwide. This study will shed light on another group adversely impacted by the FLSA: resident and migrant Mexican American, agricultural child laborers in the Southwest. This study will explore how the exemptions built into the FLSAs child labor ban facilitated farm owners evasion of protective practices. While farm owners were helping to shape the states ambivalence about the welfare of Mexican American child laborers, a discourse of racial liberalism that applied to all agricultural child laborers without adequate access to the right to childhood emerged.Few updates have been made to the child labor ban of the 1938 FLSA. In fact, in 2011, then-Department of Labor Secretary, Hilda Solis, proposed revisions to child labor regulations in the U.S. to protect young agricultural workers.

Termed migrant psychosis, this scientifically-framed malady was offered as a formal diagnosis of the homesickness that recent arrivals felt for countries of origin and the families left, and their alienation from U.S. culture and society. This diagnosis, however, was not evenly applied; rather, it was largely used to treat the illnesses of Mexican im/migrants and other stoop laborers and laborers of color. These im/migrants alone were psychologically unable to adjust to the demands of a modern U.S. culture and society; they were diagnosed as unassimilable. As I argue, migrant psychosis was part of the larger set of political, anthropological, social scientific, politico-economic racialization narratives; im/migrants were to be perennial outsiders to the body politic.Based on evidence from psychology and psychiatry textbooks, in tandem with oral histories of im/migrants and doctors notes and case files, the paper explores the work this diagnosis did to broaden the conceptualization and understanding of im/migrants as psychologically underdeveloped, dependent on others, and ill-prepared for political, social, and cultural integration into U.S. society. The scientific discourse about im/migrants that such diagnoses reflect, I argue, contributed to a continued racialization of im/migrant labor and the configuration of certain groups of im/migrants whose affective links to home cultures put them outside the bounds of the nation. </p>","Migrant Psychosis: Psychologizing Homesickness, Racializing Labor"

Within the Army, in particular, members evolved from a force of primarily bachelor soldiers to one centered on the nuclear family ideal.  This paper will examine the Cold War origins of the modern family focus in the U.S. military.  The rise in family aid programs, marriage training for future wives of officers and enlisted men, and the promotion of the military family in media help to frame the events within their Cold War context as part of the broader struggle of capitalism and democracy over communism.  The American military family is simultaneously a model of American cultural identity while existing almost as its own unique subculture.  Distinctions of class and race play an important part in this modelling of culture, especially when considering the differences in the policies and promotion of family within the officer and enlisted corps.  By exploring this diversity within the early Cold War promotion of military family, I will show how the institution sought to model itself for the world.

From early in its history, the Shaker movement issued a sharp challenge to the American mainstream by promoting a set of social and spiritual values so radical as to be alien to American identity itself. With the passage of time, however, many of those distinctive Shaker values have been widely reassessed by outsiders as precursors to changes that American society was itself destined to eventually embrace.  Ironically, while Shaker communities contracted (but never disappeared) in the early 20th century, new waves of utopian communities grew in America that purported to draw from vital aspects of Shaker thought and practice, even while the nature of Shaker practice remained veiled and even obfuscated. This paper will examine how idealizing specific features of Shaker life has led to the creation of a dubious archetype for American utopian societies in the 20th century and beyond.</p>","Mother Of All Utopias?

Leaving aside the obvious questions and answers about the accuracy of these fashionable worn and performed histories, I consider instead the confusion that academic history faces when it encounters a history organized not on the level of facts or objectivity, but on the level of feelings, bodies, amateurs. Post-structuralist, post-positivist historiographers have long pointed out that historys science of facts is illusory, itself a matter of faith as much as any historical modes objective history sought to displace, but affective and embodied histories, such as those enacted through heritage fashions remain hard to evaluate by the standards of academic historiography.

Today, the term humanism is most often associated either with scientific rationalism (secular humanism) or assumptions about a universal human nature, which are disputed by postmodern thinkers.  In the early twentieth century, however, humanist projects often encapsulated broad-ranging programs of cultural and social renewal that attempted to meet the perceived moral and spiritual needs of modern people.  Looked at now, these multifarious humanist movements cast the fissures in contemporary American intellectual life into stark relief.One such fissure divides secular from religious thinkers.  Some humanists saw themselves as transcending this divide and overcoming the limitations of both theology and philosophy.  The University of Pittsburgh philosopher Oliver L. Reiser provides a case in point.  In the 1930s, Reiser joined a group of Unitarian ministers, unorthodox religious thinkers, scientists, and Deweyan thinkers to publish the Humanist Manifesto in 1933, a plea for a liberal, non-theistic religion.  In the following years, many moved on to a scientific and naturalistic humanism shorn of the earlier religious pretensions, however, Reiser soldiered on, eventually propounding a cosmic humanism.  By the 1960s and 1970s he attached himself to various projects that might fulfill the project of global integration and spiritual transcendence, including Project Prometheus based on global satellite communications as the means to further the understanding of the idea of mankind; the Committee for the Futures synergistic conference, or SYNCON, featuring the creation of a SYNCON wheel; and The Cooperators, a consortium aiming to create a map of the world.  By the 1960s, Reiser had become a living connection between different eras of spiritual aspiration and an emblem of an older tradition of public philosophy.</p>","Oliver L.

Charged with organizing Mexican Americans in East Los Angeles, he developed an activist strategy that pushed the state at all levels to recognize them as political subjects.  He made some headway.  Investing in the political process as a strategy to further inclusion and rights, the multi-racial—though largely Mexican American—CSO developed effective organizing strategies that helped make Mexican Americans a prominent constituency in Californias postwar political landscape.  This paper examines CSO organizing goals and strategies in relationship to the broader terrain of alternative political projects.  It draws on archival collections and popular press to illustrate the ways that Ross emphasized particular narratives of Mexican American history in the recent past to justify inclusion: military service, labor, anti-communism. In doing so, the CSO both pushed boundaries of national inclusion while overlooking opportunities to participate in alternative political projects aligned across national boundaries.Scholarship on Mexican American political activism and on the long and wide civil rights movement recognizes the CSOs role in the states inclusionary expansion. Yet the CSOs discursive strategies, designed to both foster Mexican American community activism and gain recognition, also reveal the seduction of the existing liberal democratic political project and the limits to alternative framings of pluralist political spaces and projects.</p>","Organizing For Activism: The Community Service Organization And The Liberal State"

The group, spanning from Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New Mexico organized Mexican American, Asian American, and African American workers to establish cross-racial coalitions that would then utilize the readings of Karl Marx, Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, and Vladimir Lenin to create a workers revolution within the United States. The major question this study seeks to explore is why the ATMs political trajectory during the global Cold War created the notion that it was the vanguard party to lead United States workers of different ethnic backgrounds for social change? The first half of this paper explores the ATM as an organization constantly seeking to create multi-racial coalitions, or what Jeffrey Ogbar has termed rainbow radicalism, with the Black Panther Party of the Black Power Movement, I Wor Kuen of the Asian American Movement, and Amiri Barakas Congress of Afrikan People. The second half will explore the merging of the ATM, IWK, and CAP in 1978 to form the multiracial communist organization known as the League of Revolutionary Struggle.The members of the ATM conducted mass organizing work in factories, farms, and against the Bakke decision that banned affirmative action in 1978. They also produced joint newspapers with other groups while providing translations of group polemics for one another so that they could reach workers of different ethnic backgrounds. An analysis of the ATMs major union activism highlights their difficulties organizing undocumented workers, Spanish-speaking workplaces, Chinese-speaking workplaces, and factories with different racial demographics. The strikes create an opportunity for historians to analyze how social movement groups crossed racial lines to support workers struggles. LRS, as this paper will argue, represents a multiracial coalition based on the Marxist canon and also shows the long political life trajectories of activists from identity based movements of the 1960s and 1970s. This paper will confront how the representation of race and class via Marxist-Leninist activists still needs to be addressed by historians. It will also provide commentary on the theoretical debates presented by activists who utilized the Marxist canon as a form of theory and praxis. The tension between having political classes and organizing workers, I argue, makes the LRS a key organization for understanding how the activism of the 1970s changed over time into the 1990s.</p>","Organizing Multiracial Workplaces: The Activism Of The League Of Revolutionary Struggle 1974-1991"

Municipal officials, who faced constrained budgets as the citys property tax bases declined, struggled with how best to respond to the panic over crime. This paper examines how in reaction to the perceived inadequacies of governmental responses to crime, New Yorkers began to launch their own anti-crime initiatives. By the early 1970s, city dwellers had formed well over one hundred resident-led neighborhood patrols and anti-crime community groups.The proliferation of these grassroots efforts, this paper argues, helped facilitate major expansions in government and private sector responses to crime, ones that historians have commonly depicted as resulting overwhelmingly from the actions of elites and powerful officials. For one, the thousands of community members who began taking a more active role in crime prevention formed a powerful and increasingly organized constituency that demanded more punitive government responses to crime, including increased policing and harsher sentencing. At the same time, their emphasis on the supposed need to supplement municipal policing helped facilitate the development and expansion of private security forces. Private sector funded patrols formed throughout business districts in the late 1970s and 1980s, joining the citizen-led patrols in residential areas. Everyday New Yorkers, this paper therefore argues, helped to spur both increased criminalization and the private sectors expanded role in policing during the final decades of the twentieth century.</p>","Patrolling The Neighborhood:  Citizen Responses To Crime In 1970s New York"

Planters, for example, studied chemists such as Francis Home and Count Rumford to improve making manure from the waste of enslaved people and livestock, and to feed both slaves and animals calculated diets of fodder. Moreover, planters began studying global experiments in planting crops, especially sugar and wheat, as far afield as Scotland, Egypt, and India, and began understanding plantership through the lens of global ecological and climatic patterns. Through scientific societies, planters experimented with new improvements for harnessing, quantifying, and improving the energetic potential of slaves and animals, which they termed the nerves and sinews of plantations. In farm books, manuals, and printed treatises, planters quantified the energy of enslaved Africans and livestock, computing how much dung could be accumulated from either, and how much muscle-power each provided on the plantation. In doing so, they seamlessly knit African slavery into the ideology of improvement and political arithmetic, and networks of global exchanges in scientific information. Using case studies from Barbados and Virginia, I argue that by the end of the eighteenth century, planters in both regions embraced the scientific identity of enlightened European experimentalists, while retaining the classical ideal of the virtuous husbandman and paternal slaveholder.</p>","Plantation Nerves And Sinews: Science And Slaveholding In Barbados And Virginia, 1765-1800"

Their narratives reflect the widespread importance of meeting their childrens needs and the value of their relationships with one another across time and space, but also how the precariousness of the labor made them vulnerable to law enforcement.

However, long before HUAC blacklisted these entertainers, the Dies Committee, the predecessor of HUAC, also targeted the entertainment industry. The Dies Committee, formed in 1937 to investigate Fascism in the United States, instead turned its attention to Communism. In particular, the committee focused on attempting to expose communists in the Roosevelt administration. During the course of these widely publicized hearings, the Dies Committee investigated the Federal Theater project, and other Hollywood entertainers, including then 10-year-old Shirley Temple. In so doing, the Dies Committee politicized entertainment, and paved the way for the serious accusations and blacklists that would follow more than ten years later.

Fifties adolescence often represented a pre–Vietnam War, pre–civil rights movement, pre–womens liberation American innocence. In this paper, I build on the existing scholarship around nostalgia, culture, and memory to analyze pregnancy scares and abortion in pop culture and to explore the ways that their portrayal reflected conflicts over gender and sexuality. For example, in both the 1974 film The Lords of Flatbush and the 1978 hit Grease, which depicted romanticized working-class fifties teen greasers, the plots included pregnancy scares. In both films, the scares turned out to be unnecessary: in Lords of Flatbush it was the invention of a girl who wanted to leverage her boyfriend toward marriage, and in Grease, the girl discovered she was not pregnant after all. In the movies, the pregnancy danger—a potentially deadly serious consequence of premarital sex, given the perils of illegal abortion and strictly enforced sexual double standard in the 1950s—simply disappeared. Thus, the messy contests over sex, gender, and reproduction that would be raised by unmarried pregnant teenage girls—the contests so viscerally playing out in American society in the 1970s—were obviated. In other words, one of the main loci for social and political conflict in the 1970s was erased through these nostalgic cultural products that looked back toward a simpler time. These nostalgic productions avoided both the ill will stirred by debates over gender and sex in the 1970s as well as public outcries over depictions of abortion in pop culture, such as the backlash against the 1972 TV show Maude after two 1972 episodes centered on the main characters decision to have an abortion. At the same time, abortion was becoming a national political issue, one suffused with concerns about history. Abortion politics in the 1970s was deeply imbedded in a politicized cultural obsession with the past, and partisans on all sides of the abortion issue reflected that obsession with rhetorical strategies that sought to justify their positions with historicized appeals. Antiabortion activists often framed their arguments around an appeal to moral traditions rooted in two versions of the past—one a religious past shaped by immutable moral truths, the other a historical tradition of American law. In turn, abortion rights activists reacted to the right to life movements appeal to the morally correct recent past by constructing a narrative of temporal progress along with a symbolic specter that would represent the dangers of going back: the potentially lethal back-alley illegal abortion. Both groups arguments used the past as a form of political appeal.How did a politics of the past connect these two realms—the political and the cultural? I want to use this forum to explore the ways that visions of the past affected and were influenced by the politics of sex, gender, and abortion in the 1970s.</p>","Pop Culture Nostalgia, Sex, And The Politics Of Abortion In The 1970s"

This paper examines her role in the FDAs effort to define potentially pregnant women as a vulnerable population that was codified in 1977 guidelines. The FDAs definition of pregnant women was expansive, limiting participation of most women of childbearing potential in clinical trials save the incarcerated. The prohibition had far-reaching implications: with limited information on the impact of drugs on expectant women, most product labels simply stated that safety had not been assessed for pregnant women. Nevertheless, these therapeutic orphans, sometimes had severe illnesses and used prescribed medications despite unknown consequences, effectively creating a new study population. Memorandums circled at the FDA in the 1970s about how to manage these thorny ethical questions. Yet by the 1990s, critics decried exclusionary policies, arguing that they were paternalistic or too restrictive. This presentation details the FDAs shifting approach to defining potentially fertile women as a vulnerable population in assessments of drug safety, contextualized in broader debates of the period about pregnancy and reproductive autonomy.</p>","Potentially Pregnant: Frances Kelsey And The Post-Thalidomide Construction Of Women Of Childbearing Potential As A Vulnerable Population"

As a result, literature on Civil War prisons and prisoners has traditionally examined the conditions of prisons, the politics and policies that led to so many deaths, and the virulent postwar sectional disputes about wartime culpability for prison casualties. Prisons, however, were also spaces where war uniquely influenced prisoners psyches, individually and collectively. They had the time and imperative to write reassuring letters home, comforting loved ones. But because prisons employed censors and imposed page limits to correspondence, prisoners also had to carefully examine both the content and style of what they wrote. The result is a unique epistolary culture in which prisoners and their loved ones created ways to make sense not only out of the events of the war but the meaning of the war itself. This paper explores the influence of prison structures, especially censorship, on this genre of wartime writing. Specifically, it argues that captured soldiers, when they turned inward to write home, as well as in diaries, created the first drafts of what would become the literature of the postwar era and the fodder for renewed sectional conflict precluding meaningful reconciliation for years to come.</p>","Prions Pens: The Culture Of Writing In Civil War Prisons"

The offices of the Free Speech and its destruction, the New York Age, and the exodus from Memphis all illustrate the mutually constitutive role of property and print media in post-emancipation black efforts for racial progress. Although many race newspapers were printed by whites, African Americans increasingly sought to produce and distribute their newspapers in separate spaces. They edited articles in the basements of black churches, opened their own printing presses, and sold copies of their papers in black-owned pharmacies and saloons. In turn, black papers encouraged economic self-help through the acquisition of property. Entire newspapers were dedicated to town boostersim, and articles frequently described the value and architectural details of black properties. Such properties became a ubiquitous aspect of the eras black visual culture. Historians have considered how portraiture illustrated African Americans conceptions of freedom but images of buildings served as equally celebrated representations of black progress.</p>","Property And The Black Press In Jim Crow America"

Rather, they codified notions about race, suburbs, and property value that real estate developers had been circulating for decades. This paper uses a public-private neighborhood protection program conducted in Baltimore between 1938 and 1940, along with its aftermath in the 1950s, to examine how during the New Deal a small group of elite white suburban developers negotiated a role in the expanding federal state, facilitating the governments adoption of older Realtor ideas as common sense.

The recent battles over obvious inequality in the City by the Bay – with homeless encampments erected next to luxury apartment towers and gleaming tech headquarters – originated in the 1970s, and punks were on the front lines.  Not only did bands write a long list of songs and anthems condemning landlords, gentrifiers, and police (among others), but punks participated in street battles in defense of evictees, burned police cars the night of the Dan White verdict, and ran their own candidate (Jello Biafra of the band Dead Kennedys) for mayor against Dianne Feinstein.  In the struggle against what David Harvey would call the dispossession of the San Francisco, punks asserted a right to the city and, allied with other citizens and activists, fought to carve out and claim spaces for their communities.  In this way, they followed, not unwittingly, a New Left prefigurative politics model by trying to build a micro-model of a society they hoped to build on a larger scale.  As this paper shows, much of this sense of possibility derived from a sense of San Francisco as a unique laboratory for cultural and political experimentation.  By examining punk history as urban history, this paper recovers the political engagement of an important, if neglected, subculture.</p>","Punk City: San Francisco At The Neoliberal Dawn"

After federal politicians failed to address the matter in the 1790s, individual citizens were left to envision their own solutions for the national problem of slavery. Could the nation continue as a divided political body? The Louisiana Purchase introduced new possibilities, as vast tracks of land theoretically provided regional space for black emancipation and settlement. Colonizationists quickly turned their attention to the West in the hopes of finally solving the slave question.Yet disagreements plagued the proposal from the beginning. White anti-slavery activists who refused to consider assimilation were challenged by black authors who wished to remain in the land they tilled. Southern slaveholders, conversely, argued that the new Louisiana Terrority was prime space for the growing slave institution. And white laborers in the North believed western territories provided necessary free soil for free white labor. How was this new region to be envisioned, let alone settled? This paper uses these debates as a lens through which to understand how Americans conceived regions during the early republic. In an expanding empire with westward ambitions, what role would these new territory play in Americas geopolitical drama? The Mississippi Valley and Midwest, terms that have become synonymous with this land, were the final products of these debates, but they were far from inevitable. Discussions concerning the Louisiana Purchase territory reveals how regions were simultaneously racialized and politicized during an era of expansion.</p>","Racializing Regions: Colonizing Louisiana Territory And The Limits Of Early American Union"

Throughout much of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, sugar was big business along the winding bayous of southeast Texas. There, the fertile soil and tropical-like climate yielded an ample supply of cane that ultimately rivaled the sugar produced domestically in places such as Louisiana and Hawaii, and to some, Texas sugar surpassed Caribbean sugar in terms of its quality. Moreover, this precious commodity also gave birth to numerous capitalist ventures in the region, and for Fort Bend County, Texas, cane production launched the start of a profitable sugar refinery, Imperial Sugar Company, which today, bears the distinction as the states oldest extant business enterprise. Though Texas sugar growers never produced the quantity of cane as their Louisiana neighbors, sugar cultivation proved quite lucrative and indeed useful to a state in constant economic distress and swarming in social chaos, either real or imagined. Sugar, furthermore, allowed Texas to dabble in leasing out the states swelling convict population to labor-hungry and profit-driven sugar planters from 1871 until 1883. And after a turbulent yet fruitful decade of leasing out its mostly black, male convict population, the state moved to purchase its own massive sugar plantations throughout the so-called Sugar Bowl and reap the financial windfall from the labor of its bound lot. Simply, sugar helped build and sustain the states prison system while exacting undue misery on thousands of black men along the way. Furthermore, this paper explores the gendered experiences of black male convicts who exclusively labored on state-owned sugar plantations from the late nineteenth to early twentieth century. By examining how gender shaped the convicts labor and leisure as a ward of state, this work draws heavily from slavery and masculinity studies to demonstrate the range of masculine models present on prison sugar farms (a homosocial space), and it endeavors to capture a more complex portrait of the black men ensnared in the states (in)justice system. Ultimately, this project challenges the assertion that black men endured the incarceration experience in a homogeneous fashion by arguing against an essentialist reading of men altogether and by highlighting the presence of various masculinities within a larger gender system that subordinates and differentiates among men, even under confinement.</p>","Raising Cane, Razing Men: A Gendered View Of The Texas Prison Empire, 1871-1920"

Yankees, calling themselves pioneers and colonizers, moved to the region in waves throughout the early 20th century and wealthy Northern investors built empires of citrus and sugar. The Indian River Farms Company of Davenport, Iowa made some of the greatest strides toward conquering and reimagining La Florida.

She began her career performing in minstrel theater, tent shows, and along the chitlin circuit of theaters and clubs in black neighborhoods.  By the early 1960s, she would finally achieve broad success with a series of wildly successful comedy albums and a steady stream of television appearances.  Born Loretta Mary Aiken, Mabley was a performer who, through a career in comedy that spanned over 60 years, cultivated and mastered incongruities:  an old woman who on stage openly expressed desire for young men; a lesbian whose assertive and raunchy straight stage persona defined her in the eyes of her adoring audiences; a harmless grandmotherly figure who used her humor to attack Jim Crow as well as sexual proscriptions.  Though seemingly without artifice when on stage, Mabley was a black woman whose life in public concealed the closely protected details of her private life.  In this paper, I will examine the archival and ethical challenges posed by reconstructing this black womans life.  In examining these challenges, I will propose a re-examination of the biographical impulse and will explore the formal innovations required to write the many stories of Jackie Moms Mabley.  </p>","Resisting Biography:  Telling The Stories Of Jackie Moms Mabley"

Historians working in both the U.S. and Mexico documents the perspectives and actions of U.S. and Mexican officials and reveal the experience of those who were repatriated. However, they tend to make arguments relevant to either U.S. or Mexican historiography and focus on Mexicans departure from the United States and their arrival and settlement in Mexico. In conversation with new scholarship on repatriation, this paper contributes to earlier work by examining repatriates efforts to return to the United States and by thinking critically about the relationship between repatriates and U.S. citizenship. Instead of assuming that citizenship held no value for U.S.-born Mexicans who were repatriated, I demonstrate that citizenship was a site of negotiation. Using archival sources from Mexico and the United States, this paper examines repatriates strategies to claim U.S. citizenship and to secure aid from the U.S. government. In claiming U.S. citizenship, repatriates replicated formal political strategies used by migrants, used their transnational familial networks, and echoed New Deal and Depression era discourse, particularly new conceptions of citizenship. By examining repatriates claims to U.S. citizenship during the Great Depression, we can gain a better understanding of migrant-state relations, the limits and possibilities of practicing U.S. citizenship in Mexico, and the role of transnational families.</p>","Return Migration During The Great Depression: Citizenship, U.S.-Born Repatriates, And The State"

The way in which newspapers presented these cases--dwelling on the pastors theological hypocrisy and adding a sprinkling of vivid descriptions of the young attractive female parishioners with whom the ministers disappeared--raised questions about sexuality, religious authority, and morality that the press had not considered since the infamous Beecher-Tilton scandal of the mid-1870s. Here, scandal became a test of religious authenticity, and the increasing publicity of elopement cases made mainstream ministers newly vulnerable to secular skepticism and gratuitous scrutiny. This presentation will interrogate the genre of scandal as a form of history and discuss how historians can use digital history tools to present historical phenomena like the rise of religious scandal coverage in the media in new and compelling ways.</p>","Reverends On The Run: Ministerial Elopement Scandals In The Gilded Age Press"

During this period, early works of community history such as &quot;Nothing Left in My Hands: The Issei of a Rural California Town, 1900-1942&quot; (1978) and &quot;Linking Our Lives: Chinese American Women of Los Angeles&quot; (1984) were based on ideas about knowledge production and dissemination that were generally distinct from those of the traditional field of American history. During a period when the mainstream discipline of history largely promoted the idea that historical research should be directed first at fellow academics before eventually trickling down to a broader public audience, community historians in Asian American studies saw the communities they were working with as the primary audience of their scholarship.  Where as mainstream American historians were concerned primarily with making academic interventions, Asian American community historians were often more concerned with the ways in which documenting the history of Asian American communities could advance the political empowerment of those same communities. Where as traditional American historians tended to be professionals affiliated with universities who worked alone, community historians tended to be Asian American community members without professional training in the field of history who often chose to produce their projects collaboratively. While aspects of this community history ethos remain in the field today, for the most part historians of the  Asian American experience now subscribe to the norms of the discipline of American history. Tracing the genealogy of Asian American community history from its origins in the 1970s and 1980s through the present, this presentation argues that community history is a distinct form of historical inquiry with methods, objectives, and forms that differ from those most dominant in the field of American history. While acknowledging the real benefits that have occurred from the instutionalization and acceptance of Asian American history within American academy, I argue that key aspects of the process of community history as practiced by Asian American studies in the 1970s and 1980s can and should be adopted more readily by scholars of  Asian American history today. Drawing on community history projects that I oversaw during my eight years as a historian at the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California in Los Angeles Chinatown, and also on my dissertation Performing Chinatown: Hollywood, Tourism, and the Formation of a Los Angeles Community, 1931-1949, I demonstrate how the advent of digital tools such as the ease of video recording and digital scanning make adopting aspects of community historys methods, objectives, and forms that much easier. If publishing primarily for academics in professional journals is the price that Asian American history has paid for its institutionalization within the American academy, then this talk suggests that digital technology can allow scholars to combine the best aspects of community history and institutionalized Asian American history scholarship to produce new forms of Asian American history that speak to the scholarly and political needs of our current moment. </p>","Revitalizing Asian American Community History"

Retailers often determine what is manufactured and by whom, how it is transported, and how much it costs. Retailing has changed American work. Ringing up customers became the new default working-class job in the late twentieth century; by 2015 cashiers and salespersons were the largest U.S. occupations. Yet the jobs were poorly paid, often part-time or temporary, and came with paltry benefits, if any. Women worker were central to retail&quot;s ascendance. In fact, by the 1970s the new retail workforce was increasingly young, female and African-American. Nearly three-quarters of sales clerks and 88 percent of cashiers were women, including more African-Americans than ever before. Many of these female retail workers, it turns out, did not back down easily when they faced de-skilling and the gutting of wage and benefits standards that were hallmarks of a neoliberal financialized capitalism. Using evidence from department store and grocery union organizing campaigns and union contracts in the 1970s and 1980s, this paper explores how female sales clerks, cashiers and distribution center workers fought for alternatives to the low-road employment policies that mark the retail workers&quot; experience today.  </p>","Rosa The Retailer: Women, Unions And Resistance In The Retail Workforce"

Both fairs were efforts by city boosters to claim San Franciscos role as the queen city of the West Coast, if not the Pacific Rim itself.  Local residents who deeply believed in locating California as a Pacific state and in crafting a future for the region with a destiny facing west instead of east, actively shaped both fairs to meet their goals. In 1915, that meant crafting a fair that welcomed the nations of China and Japan, despite domestic anti-Asian sentiment. By 1939, this meant the involvement of the Institute of Pacific Relations, an organization founded to focus on international attention on research and policy-making in the Pacific.  In the 1930s, the flourishing interest nationally and internationally, in culture, and in preserving so-called traditional culture, also lent an important element to the fair, as exhibits celebrated both consumerism and primitivism simultaneously. The result was an image of the Pacific that highlighted the unique cultures and peoples of the region as well as the economic possibilities available to savvy investors, all with the underlying goal of peace in the Pacific, in a distinct difference from the PPIE, which presented a much more dichotomized vision of race and culture. This paper will therefore use visual sources to examine how and why the vision of the city, and its role in the Pacific, changed between 1915 and 1939. Sources such as the fairs publicity posters and pamphlets, public school curricula, artwork, and exhibits will allow us to discuss just how these massive cultural events help to shape a vision of the Pacific World for the millions of visitors who entered their gates. Who did, and did not, have a voice in constructing these images of the Pacific? What role did San Francisco culture and politics play in shaping the fairs relationship to the Pacific? Those are the questions this paper will answer in an attempt to understand how the two fairs help us understand both western urban development and national political and economic priorities in the pre-World War II United States. </p>","San Francisco's World's Fairs And The Pacific World: 1915 And 1939 "

The people in Lizards town planned to steal fire from Eagle, who selfishly kept the fire under his wings.  The people teamed up, stole the fire, and raced with it back to town.  Before they reached their roundhouse (a traditional building in which the people held ceremonies), however, Coyote grabbed the fire, dropped it and set the entire Sacramento Valley ablaze.  Traditionally, scholars have treated oral traditions, such as the story of Lizard, as quaint myths.  This paper argues that oral traditions are an Indigenous version of Californias history and engaged in broader political events of the Great Depression. Concows possessed a visual understanding of the past; when they saw their landmarks they could recall stories about their history. Concows used to claim their indigenousness to California, refuting the efforts of Americans to make themselves first in California. Concows also employed oral traditions to claim the land and places from which the federal government had removed Concows in the 1860s.  McLaine and other Concows referred to landmarks in the Sacramento Valley by their Concow names and with the Concow language.  Finally, oral traditions provided Concows with a path to follow in the future.

By demonstrating how claimants used these tribunals to question the governments ability to protect life and property within its borders, the project explains why a key conceptual and institutional framework for American expansion developed at mid-nineteenth century fell apart during the first decades of the twentieth, and considers the legacies of its collapse for the ways the United States would use international law to facilitate its imperial ventures.</p>","Settlement Colonialism In The Long Nineteenth Century And Its Aftermath"

Outside of this legality, there were a number of rape cases and sexual abuses committed, not only by stationed units, but also by the military police, Kempei tai.  This legality of state sponsored sex work was carried onto R.A.A. (Recreation and Amusement Association) in postwar Japan.  It was supposed to have ended when GHQ prohibited it in the early part of 1946.  Nonetheless, wherever American forces were stationed, red light district flourished in different parts of Japan and local administrative units were forced to partake in their maintenance. Here is where the notion of &quot;state sponsored sex work&quot; needs rethinking.  Then, when the Korean War started and the 8th Army advanced to Korea, once again the Korean state provided formal &quot;state sponsored sex work,&quot; and hence, the notion of Korean comfort women for the U.N forces. Based on sources from Cebu under Japanese occupation and Yokohama / Yokosuka under American occupation, this paper will provide new perspectives on trans-border histories of sex and war. </p>","Sex And War: State Sponsored Sex From The Philippines To Japan To Korea, 1941-1953"

Historians agree that the interrelated concerns of gender and sex were peripheral to most nineteenth-century social experiments, including in the many Fourierist communities founded in the 1840s. Fourierist themselves, especially the movements male leaders, vehemently denied that male and female communitarians engaged in any scandalous sexual relationships. In practice, many Fourierists rejected sexual propriety, and they continued to do so long after their communities disintegrated. This paper argues for a continuity of sexual experimentation from the Fourierist heyday of the 1840s through the late nineteenth century. This paper examines the integration of sexual experimentation into American utopianism through the career of Marie Howland, a former Lowell mill girl, writer, and ardent socialist. In the late 1850s, she resided in an urban Fourierist household known as the Unitary Home. In the 1880s, she moved to Mexico to help establish the colony of Topolobampo. In 1921, Howland died at the Fairhope, Alabama, single-tax community.  A lifelong communitarian, Marie Howland saw sexual respectability as the principle obstacle to both socialism and womens independence.</p>","Sexual Socialism In 19Th-Century Utopias"

Although men almost always outnumbered women in the poor farms of the American Midwest (and elsewhere) women often utilized the poor farm for different reasons than men, both as residents and employees.  With no maternity facilities, women went there to give birth.  With no shelters for abused women, they fled there to get away from dangerous spouses.  With no relatives nearby, women went there with children when they had no home.  With few opportunities for cash wages, many women picked up work at the local poor farm.  With no family member who would allow them a place in their home, older often widowed women went there feeling abandoned and alone.  As employers, poor farms served as economic engines for local women who sewed, cleaned, cooked, and nursed.  From teenagers to widows, women played an important role in providing care and services.  Few poor farms functioned without women working there as matrons, and occasionally women served as superintendents themselves.  Female residents were more likely to be younger and in extreme distress of a temporary nature.  These gendered dynamics expose important distinctions of local social welfare provisions and tell a story of daily institutional life that nuances our understanding of women in rural communities.      </p>","Shelter And Security: The County Poor Farm As A Women's Resource"

Many were persuaded by Russian artist Wassily Kandinskys assertion in On the Spiritual in Art (1911) that modern art should be a form of creative transcendence, and that modern artists were compelled by inner necessity toward the spiritual life, to which art belongs.  Aiming to transcend limiting secular, material, and commercial understandings of art, these American moderns looked to religious teachings, symbols, and rituals to forge more spiritually resonant forms of visual and material culture.  They were not religious artists but spiritual seekers: American moderns who doubted mainstream religious dogma, especially the faith traditions in which they had been raised, and explored a multitude of other sacred cultures in their search for self, serenity, and emphatically independent versions of American modernism.  Disaffected by what they perceived as the restrictions of traditional religious belief, spiritual seekers sought mystical experiences that were personally and aesthetically liberating.  Their spiritual modernism represents an important contribution to the history and meaning of twentieth century American art, although critical and curatorial suspicions about faith stemming from secularization theories of modernity have, until relatively recently, prohibited engaged studies of the links between art and belief in modern times.  This paper argues for more efficacious approaches to the cultural work of religion in modern American art. </p>","Spiritual Searching: Twentieth Century Modern American Artists And The Quest For Meaning."

While it is hard to prove that migration itself caused many suicides, the phenomenon generated extensive and revealing documentation that can shed new light on the old debate over whether immigrants felt uprooted. Some German immigrants who chose death expressed distinctive feelings of discouragement (Entmutigung) and alienation or foreignness (Fremdheit) in suicide notes and in the words and actions later recorded in inquest transcripts and newspaper reports. Other German Americans wrote about suicide in letters, commentaries, and fictional accounts such as Casper Butzs 1851 poem Heimwehtod (Death from homesickness). They sometimes depicted suicide as a logical way for sensitive Germans to respond to a socially and culturally barren country obsessed with profit. In short, German immigrants embedded suicide in communal understandings of the emotional toll of migration, using an identifiably German language of suffering and relating unbearable anguish to mundane hardships. While suicide remained exceptional, it fit within widely held assumptions about German character, the United States, and migration. This paper takes seriously the sort of emotional turmoil evoked in Susan Matts Homesickness (2011) and Oscar Handlins The Uprooted (1951), but also incorporates the insights of Handlins numerous critics and historians who have studied immigrant community building. I approach emotions culturally, informed especially by Barbara Rosenweins work. Ultimately, I conclude, even personal feelings of dislocation can best be understood in the context of the emotional norms of immigrant communities.</p>","Suicide And German-American Emotional Communities"

The seven-seat bar sparked a food trend with white coastal elites and eventually a global craze for raw fish, rice, and sake. But Kawafuku during the 1960s represented the height of the first boom in popularity for a Japanese dish—sukiyaki. Seating hundreds a night, Nakajima served a soy sauce-based hot pot dish of beef, tofu and vegetables first used in Japanese treaty ports during the 1850s to introduce meat into the local diet. Scholars of Japanese culinary globalization have overlooked the transnational circulation and popularization of sukiyaki. In doing so, they have failed to explore the interconnected nature between the formation of immigrant society and the development of pathways of consumption for Japanese food products. Relying on Japanese-language community histories and various Japanese corporate archival sources, I argue that between the 1920s and 1960s sukiyaki served on ocean liners and in Nikkei restaurants was a key culinary practice in shaping American ideas about Japanese culture and tradition. By tracing the spread of sukiyaki from Japanese treaty ports to American tables, we also illuminate the migrant role in an expanding, transnational network of food importers who met Nikkei demand for soy sauce and other flavors of home as well as a growing American appetite for Japanese cuisine. We find that Nikkei entrepreneurs laid the economic and cultural foundations for the global sushi economy. </p>","Sukiyaki: Japanese Migration And The Global Circulation Of Japanese Hot Pot"

Unfortunately, I am beginning to feel the same vibrations from the Diocese. Her frustrations were not unique – beginning in the mid-1960s, white Catholics in Brooklyn began to feel neglected by their church as it increased its outreach in non-white and non-Catholic neighborhoods through a Diocesan War on Poverty. Outside of their families, the church was the most important source of identity, socialization, and community for urban Catholics, and its increasing advocacy of liberal policies created tensions with conservative parishioners. This paper will trace the eroding political authority of the Catholic Church in the lives of white Brooklyn Catholics. While urban historians have examined the politics of the working-class during this period in relation to other institutions central to their lives – namely, political parties and labor unions – they have omitted the church. As Catholics began to cast doubt on the ability of these institutions to speak on their behalf, this paper will show, they sought new means of representation in the emerging conservative movement. Through this form of grassroots protest, they remade the Catholic Church into a more politically restrained institution that had the authority to speak on moral but not political matters.    </p>","Taming The Activist Church: Catholic Conservatives In Brooklyn"

Stone in a letter to fellow right-wing activist Kent Courtney. Stone considered the federal government the greatest threat to individual and economic freedom in the United States, and he often employed conspiratorial anti-communist rhetoric to demonize liberalism and state power. Despite their prevalence, radical conservatives have garnered little attention from historians. This paper addresses this omission by analyzing the political activism and influence of Willis E. Stone and his ultraconservative organization, the Liberty Amendment Committee. From the early 1960s through the mid-1970s, Stone served as the national chairman for the Liberty Amendment Committee, building an organization dedicated to stringent fiscal conservatism. He single-mindedly pursued the ratification of the Liberty Amendment, which called for the retrenchment of federal economic interventionism and the repeal of the sixteenth amendment. The Liberty Amendment received support from right-wing politicians like Congressman James B. Utt (R-CA) and far-right champions like Billy James Hargis and Kent Courtney, and Stone utilized grassroots organizing and mass publications to connect far-right platforms to mainstream politics. More broadly, Stone and the Liberty Amendment Committee contributed to the formation of modern conservatism by providing an outlet for disillusioned right-wingers and acting as a point of convergence for mainstream and far-right conservatives.</p>","Taxation As Tyranny: Willis E.

The fledging denomination took steps in the mid 1920s to organize as a religious body with congregations in the U.S. and Mexico. Since its inception, the Asamblea Apostólica was comprised mostly of Mexican farmworkers, and members sought creative ways to carve out a social existence in Californias factories in the fields. The funding to build their temples adds another layer of social complexity to this narrative of dogged resilience. The financial contributions of workers in a colonial labor system could hardly sustain a movement much less finance a building project, so women set out to finance the building of new temples through the sale of tamales. In fact, most churches in the Central Valley stayed afloat and financed larger projects with funds generated by the sale of tamales made by women in their own or church kitchens. As a place where women ministered to one another, devised new project plans, and even critically examined decisions and sermons, the kitchen was arguably the most important space second only to the sanctuary of worship. When members of the church attained better jobs (cannery work for women and construction or factory work for men), they relied less on the sales of handmade goods and foods as fundraisers. For them, money indeed grew from the ground and came from ground corn. </p>","Temples Made With Hands: Mexican Pentecostal Women And The Construction Of Farmworker Temples In Central Valley"

The Educating Harlem edited volume argues that Harlems educational history is best described as an ongoing contestation across the course of the 20th century, rather than the more familiar arc of the rise and fall of an urban school system. Harlems educational activism was multiple and varied, motivated by a wide range of visions of educational processes and outcomes, and carried forth by diverse groups of local actors. Although less tightly organized around a single argument, the Educating Harlem Digital Collection in development supports this argument by featuring a range of voices (via primary sources and oral histories) as well as a range of knowledge producers (high school students through established scholars) in narrating Harlems education history digitally.

Davenport had toured theaters in the Atlantic world since her debut as a child star in the 1830s. Camille was part of her ongoing efforts to sustain her purchase as a star in a competitive entertainment culture.This paper will explore how actresses in the 1850s adapted female-centered French melodramas in their efforts to launch and sustain careers as touring stars. In the U.S., success meant appealing to theaters expanding white middle-class publics, particularly women. Actresses and the managers and playwrights with whom they collaborated on these plays entered an ongoing cultural struggle over public knowledge and discussion of female erotic desire and sexual vice.In 1856, American actress Matilda Heron introduced a shockingly raw portrayal of Marguerite Gauthier in New York. Ladies fainted, sobbed, then clamored to see it again. One critic described the performance as the outgushings of a womans soul stripped of all the conventional traditions of the stage and leaving only the truth of womans nature. Heron had developed the character in tours of the West, developing a distinctive acting style that was identified as American.

This clashed with the U.S.  anti-Communist agenda that they had brought to the negotiating table.  The surge of socialist and populist political movements and a more nationalist and pluralist interpretation of Democracy across the region threatened Trumans ability to sell its Cold War agenda.  The self-determination agenda dominated initial negotiations but the dynamics quickly changed after Colombias populist Democratic Party leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán was assassinated as the regional negotiations unfolded.  His assassination ignited El Bogotazo, the violent populist manifestation that marked the beginning of the longest Civil War in the Americas. President Truman and Secretary Marshall capitalized on the uprising to use public diplomacy as an instrument to sell their anti-Communist agenda at the conference.  The paper argues that Trumans anti-Communist propaganda campaign launched by Secretary Marshall from Colombia marked the beginning of the Cold War in the Americas, setting the precedent for Containment policies across the Global South.  The public diplomacy strategy implemented in Colombia showed positive results, revealing its transferability to other regions of the world where self-determination posed a threat to U.S. global policy.

Beginning in the late-nineteenth century, African American performing troupes put on tent shows throughout the South, performing under canvas tents in rural areas that did not have theaters which welcomed black audiences. Tent shows soon became associated with country and vaudeville blues acts, such as Ma Rainey and Her Washboard Tub Band. However, another common association with tent shows was female impersonators on the black vaudeville and minstrelsy circuits, who were often called tent show queens. Richard Little Richard Penniman got his start in performance on this circuit and was a tent show queen himself, appearing under the name Princess LaVonne. The liminal form of the tent show – a temporary performance space that mimicked but did not reproduce all of the conventions of a traditional theater – is a generative site through which to understand early black queer performances.

Although criminal law was proactively used as an instrument of colonialism and a means to suppress Indigenous rights and cultural practices by U.S. authorities in Alaska during the territorial period, there were moments when the courtroom could become - however briefly - not just a space of colonial oppression but one that allowed for the meeting and integration of Western and Indigenous legal tradition. Mediated though their voices were by the lawyers who represented them, witness statements, motions, and jury instructions included in the records give us access both to the voices of the Indigenous men who were charged with murder in these cases and the Indigenous legal principles that explained their actions and framed their understanding of the issues. Taken together, these cases allow us to examine the courtroom itself as a borderland where the meeting of two separate legal traditions produced outcomes that cannot be fully understood by reference to Western legal tenets alone.</p>","The Courtroom As Site Of Colonial Contact: Encounters Between Western And Indigenous Legal Tradition In Alaska's Territorial Courts"

With clever posters that claim, the corporation has no belly button! protestors impulse has been to insist that the corporation is not a person. Many critics agree that corporate personhood is a dangerous social fiction, while some legal scholars dismiss the uproar, saying its just a metaphor. This paper insists that corporations are and have been people ever since they became enchanted in the late nineteenth century. The paper traces enchantment by examining the 1890 incorporation of the American Tobacco Company (ATC). Two elements were necessary for enchantment. First, the ATC formed under New Jerseys new, controversial incorporation laws that put virtually no limit on corporate activities. Second, when facing legal challenge, the ATC successfully used the 14th Amendment to claim federal protection from state regulation, creating crucial precedents for corporate entities claiming constitutional human rights. African American men, in contrast, found that states could limit their use of the 14th Amendment through segregation laws. Corporate and human legal personhood, then, played out on the same legal field. Because the law is a closed system of symbols, this enhanced corporate personhood was not a social fiction but a legal fact with great material consequence. Taking issue with Webers notion that Western managerial bureaucracy rationalized economic life, the paper ends by showing how the legal economic life of corporate persons generated a magical effervescence that transferred to entrepreneurs.</p>","The Enchantment Of The Corporate Person"

In fact, some political leaders and commentators suggested that the Vietnam Syndrome had finally been vanquished and that the United States could once again pursue a bold foreign policy without fear of becoming embroiled in another Vietnam.  But controversy over the war and its supposed lessons surged powerfully after the turn of the century, above all in the years after the U.S. intervention in Iraq turned into a grueling counterinsurgency war that reminded some commentators of the American experience in Southeast Asia forty years earlier.  This paper will focus on the various ways in which politicians and policymakers used the Vietnam analogy during the years since 2001.  The goal will not be to determine the correct lessons of the Vietnam War or to prescribe a particular way of using history to inform the present.  Rather, the purpose will be to offer a typology of the various schools of thought surrounding the Vietnam War and its relevance for policymaking in the era of terrorism.

Inspired by a 1970s medicine show performance at the International Brotherhood of Magic Conference in Las Vegas, magician Scott McClelland created his act, Professor Crookshank, the Purveyor of Wonderment, who promises to be the perfect panacea for everyday conundrums…just what the doctor ordered! Other contemporary magicians also take up this performance as quack doctors and salesmen: Dr. Wilson (Paul Szauser) peddles a medical elixir, J. Phineas Flusterbeck (Mark Nilsen) offers a Blue Root Elixir, and Dyno Staats blends medicine with science and steampunk in his Las Vegas circuit. McClelland, Szauser, Nilsen, and Staats all draw upon the histories of itinerant medicine and performance to craft their magical patter, reiterating popular conceptions of the nineteenth-century performance, medicine, and practice.   Magic performers have often traded on historical figures or epochs in order to cultivate interesting performances; however, these have not been examined as a form of history in and of itself.  In this paper,  I propose to explore the popular histories that magicians embody and disseminate through their performances.  I specifically explore the relationships between the history of medicine, quackery, and American history these performances reimagine.   Placing the magic performer within a larger culture of historical performance (Old West reenactments and living history museums), I position the magician as both a participant and purveyor of an embodied practice of history.</p>","The Magic Of History:  Reenacting The Travelling Medicine Show"

Baby Does story is typically told as one of scandalous love and redemptive privation. This paper focuses on Tabors later life, a period when she came to be known as an eccentric recluse, dressing in rags and living outside Leadville, Colorado, in a shack next to the stubbornly unproductive Matchless Mine. Describing Baby Does material faith and penitential practices, it considers artifacts collected from Tabors shack after her death, as well as an unruly array of scraps, prayers, tea and palm readings, letters, and horoscopes, which Tabor referred to as her Dreams and Visions. While studies of frontier religion in the U.S. have tended to focus on the missionary efforts of Protestants intent to evangelize their nation and the world, this paper takes up this provocative Irish Catholic miner and her material metaphysics in order to trace the changing religious dynamics of an imperial nation in the context of volatile capital enterprises. In the process, it questions how the metaphysics of Baby Doe figure scandal as a historical practice and how the afterlife of Tabors transgressive religiosity helps showcase the formal assumptions and mysterious workings of American religious history.</p>","The Metaphysics Of Baby Doe Tabor: Scandal On The Frontiers Of American Religion"

In a few short years he has all but doubled his cinematic output, creating films that have garnered widespread critical attention.  Assessing these films, which include To the Wonder (2013), Knight of Cups (2016), the IMAX documentary Voyage of Time (also 2016), and Song to Song (2017), I hope to show how Malicks recent work channels the influence of a book that won the National Book Award in 1962, when he was still an impressionable undergraduate at Harvard.  Malick eventually abandoned a budding academic career in philosophy, but his subsequent work in Hollywood remained indebted to Walker Percys existential novel The Moviegoer.  For many years Malick was rumored to be working on an adaptation of the book.  Although that project never came to fruition, traces of Percys influence can be found in each of Malicks recent films.  That influence has informed a series of loosely autobiographical works depicting the search for both individual and cosmic meaning.  I argue that these films constitute a kind of philosophizing by other means.  My paper suggests that Percy and Malick are part of a vibrant American tradition that continues to treat philosophical inquiry not so much as an academic pursuit, but rather as a way of life.</p>","The Moviegoer As Philosopher From Walker Percy To Terrence Malick"

During the fad years, Chinese Americans capitalized on an opportunity to market their authenticity while using the same game to build a sense of Chinese American unity. In the interwar era, after the national craze died down, Chinese Americans used the game in unique ways to navigate tensions associated with Americanization, including pressure to foster inclusion, survive exclusion, and nurture intra-cultural cohesion. Mahjong could be a point of commonality across generations because it was both Chinese and American – a Chinese game whose cultural meaning transformed because of American consumption. In the context of internal debates over redeveloping Chinatowns as tourist destinations, mahjong demonstrates complex dualities of ethnic cultural creation: how Chinese Americans participated in commodifying and marketing mahjong as an aspect of Chinese culture, while also using it to create separate ethnic spaces for Chinese Americans to engage with each other.The story of how mahjong became American is also a story of particular communities becoming American in the twentieth century. The history of mahjong is, in part, the uneven history of how the nation came to identify itself as a multiracial democracy, and how different groups experienced the possibilities, limitations, and potential costs of integration. </p>","The National Game In Chinese America"

In their labor struggle, the Union said, Coachella farmworkers advanced the nations liberal egalitarianism and sought to undermine the remaining vestiges of undemocratic social relations. In turn, when American consumers boycotted Californian grapes they helped their fellow citizens fight for their shared country. This Americanist language, however, was not deployed by pro-UFW Coachella farmworkers. For them, the Union represented a variety of potential projects and futures rooted in the Mexican Revolution and Chicano Movement politics. Critically, these Mexican- and Chicano-centered projects erased the presence of migrant Filipino grape workers, (who represented a third of Coachellas grape harvest labor force), and reflected the longstanding divisions between the two racialized farmworker communities.

After all the regular season games have been played, and the conferences have sorted out their champions, the men from West Point and the Naval Academy meet in early December for their annual tussle.  The game is secondary to the pageantry that surrounds it.  Soldiers attend in mass.  Mayors and governors jockey to attract/keep the game in their jurisdictions.  The President of the United States typically attends too, crossing from one side of the field to the other at halftime in order to show neutrality.  But how did this game become a site of political theater?  And why did the political nature of the contest seem to rise as the football prowess of the service academies declined?  This project explores the politicization of the Army-Navy football game.  While politicians desire to be seen as supportive of the US Military is long-standing and not particularly difficult to explain, the dynamics surrounding the rise of this football game deserve further exploration.  The role of race at the academies, and thus as part of the game, receives special attention.  Also, the behind the scenes negotiations to host the game—usually in Philadelphia or Baltimore—are informative.  The failure of politicians in Washington DC, including the President of the United States, to secure the playing of the game in the nations capital reveals illuminating fissures within the fabric of Americas federal/state compromise.</p>","The Presidents Game: The Politicization Of The Army-Navy Football Game, 1890-1918"

Woods electoral victory was more than a symbol of the rise of black political power; rather, it ushered in a major policy shift in the city of Natchez. Responding to the votes of former slaves, Woods administration instituted major criminal justice reforms. These reforms, however, strained the biracial coalition that Wood had constructed in the racially divided city, and they show the difficulty that black officeholders faced in implementing policies that ensured freedom for the formerly enslaved. And while the national backlash against Reconstruction did no favors for Wood and his allies, it was their progressive policies and leadership that prompted local white supremacists to drive them out of office.</p>","The Radical Mayor: Biracial Coalitions And The Politics Of Justice In Reconstruction Natchez"

This version of history is only partially true.  The attitudes toward and the rules governing the involvement of women in ministry were adopted from the holiness movement that pre-dated  Pentecostals.  While early Pentecostals generally accepted women in ministry, they did so only to a degree, classifying them as evangelists or missionaries, restricting their ability to perform church rites such as baptism, and allowing them to pastor only on a temporary basis. Women seeking roles as church leaders then might look to serve only in arenas where they could lead ministries and not compete with men.              The development of the early Pentecostal organizations and thus their particular rules concerning women in ministry came at a time when the role of women was changing in the United States.  Women nation-wide had been part of reform movements such as the temperance or suffrage movements, the later of which was more controversial within the church. Thus, the women had to be careful to portray both their work and their persons in ways that did not offend more conserative male ministers.

Prior to the founding of the School, even Ph.D. students in the Humanities did not receive systematic instruction in critical theory.  Attending the School rapidly became one of the most sought after career opportunities in American academia, both because of its curriculum, as well as its prestigious faculty and board members, such as Hayden White and Edward Said. As numerous testimonial letters found in the Schools archive attest, after spending one summer at the School, the attendees- mostly junior professors- would radically change the curricula in the their undergraduate and graduate classes, thereby moving critical theory and Postmodernism from the cutting edge to a position of orthodoxy.   Thus, this paper shows how the theoretical underpinnings of Postmodernism rose to a position of dominance in the classrooms of American universities in the last quarter of the twentieth century. </p>","The Role Of The School Of Criticism And Theory In The Promulgation Of Postmodernism"

Each of these hopes, however, was dashed. Commencing with the first Red Scare, a resurgent conservative backlash took hold. At the forefront of that movement stood the Sentinels of the Republic, formed in 1922 to fight the third crisis in American history of federal paternalism. This paper recovers the history of the largely overlooked Sentinels who took aim at each of the maternalist projects, defeating the federal child labor amendment and derailing other initiatives they perceived would encroach upon the sovereignty of the white home.The paper argues the Sentinels found an effective way to galvanize opposition to the State across faith and class lines by defending the right of men to govern their families. It will explore how the male-dominated leadership of the Sentinels, comprised largely of Boston Brahmins, forged alliances with the Catholic Church, farmers, Southern industrialists and anti-suffragists. Building on scholarship recovering the activism of conservative women in the 1920s, the paper broadens that inquiry by considering how a gendered anti-statist ideology drew a diverse array of men and women into politics. Finally, by tracing the ties of the Sentinels to post-New Deal conservative lobbies, the paper proposes new ways to think about the importance of gender to the emergence of modern conservative politics.</p>","The Sentinels Of The Republic: The Politics Of The Family In Anti-Statist Activism 1922-1933"

The difference in the forms of economy was not trivial. Immigrants experienced not merely the feeling of homelessness but the shock of industrial technology, scientific discourses that had shaped the rise of American power, and a rapid pace of life associated with mechanization in US society.My paper will use state hospital records to analyze the medicalization of the shocks of transition to US society by the doctors who treated immigrant Mexicans to California between 1935-1965, paying careful attention to the scientific language that was used to justify the placement of immigrants in medical asylums operated by the state government. Reciprocally, the paper will analyze the works of art and journal accounts that immigrants produced to illuminate the subjective understandings they had of their own movement into US society, hoping thereby to provide an alternative formulation of migrant subjectivity that humanizes the intense struggle that immigrants felt as they sought to make sense of a radically different society.The competing narratives of change produced by the doctors and immigrants will be used to inquire about the morality of state policies that denied a political voice to human beings trapped in the cycles of economic change and political disfranchisement, and to understand how historical narratives can be used today to provide legal recognition to immigrants trapped in the modern US/Mexico economic relationship.</p>","The Shock Of Transition: Discourses Of Change In The Industrial State"

Indeed in the current age of social media, historians increasingly find themselves in the uncomfortable position of publicly self-promoting their work. Professional advancement often necessitates asserting themselves in the ether as the once protective walls of academic space crumble around them. Yet how to be a public intellectual and not, as Richard Hofstadter famously warned …lose his respect for the integrity, the independence, the pastness of the past? How to lend wisdom to debates of the present and bring some needed perspective, without discomforting the past. Hofstadter, and five of his fellow travellers faced this same dilemma in July of 1970  when Newsweek magazine asked them (Arthur Schlesinger, Staughton Lynd, Andrew Hacker, Daniel Boorstin, and Eugene Genovese) for 2000 word essays on the crisis of the American Spirit. Their responses occupied some 16 pages of the July 6 edition of the magazine, serving as a journalistic response to an emerging we are coming apart narrative that sought to describe how, if not why, Americans social, cultural and political fabric was unraveling. The extensive and thoughtful words of these six also helped Newsweek address three distinct challenges to the field of journalism. The substance of their responses also revealed the not so subtle battle lines that had been drawn in the field of history over the question of relevance; a dispute so hard fought  that it had created a highly contentious walk out by a new wave of social historians at the 1968 AHA Convention. Lynd and Genovese were at the center of this dispute and on opposite sides.In respecting the fields figurative Maginot Line that stood, often ineffectively, against  the pitfalls of presentism, historians then, as now, were also tempted by the need for relevance. Despite the rifts in the field, the Six straddled this line remarkably, and in the context of their essays also helped Newsweek address its substantial, though not wholly dissimilar media challenges.   Their responses exuded a credibility the media competed to regain as the Nixon-Agnew attacks against media bias continued unabated. Their essays also conformed to the more in depth expressions of a new journalism that was competing with conventional journalistic methodology. Finally, as Grahams Newsweek continued to try and catch Luces Time in the circulation competition, the essays stood as a stark contrast to Times concurrent celebration of the American flag written by Lance Morrow.Perhaps most noteworthy for historians of 2018, the six resisted the temptation to invoke historical examples or concoct historical lessons to inform the present crisis. Rather, their sweeping essays exuded their historical perspective that in itself provided an authoritative and credible perspective on the present while remaining true to the contours of a different past. They refused the temptation to present the past in ways that might wave a magic wand and alleviate public concerns about the present. </p>","The Six And The Sixties"

A year before division festered in the ranks of the State Progressive Spiritualist Association, Josie K. Folsom had become the first woman in the St. Louis history to officiate a wedding. The crest of her local fame, however, was the notoriety she received after a protégé accused her of defrauding the public through bogus mediation of the spirits. Folsom had been ordained in 1897 and had pastored the Olive Street Spiritualist Congregation Church before becoming treasurer of the state association. The charges of fraud centered on accusations that she had forged spiritual writings on cards produced during her séances and had contrived spirit pictures by transferring halftones from Post-Dispatch advertisements. Folsom rebuffed the accusations, claiming that she stands for religion, not for fraud, but her defense and numerous appeals were unsuccessful.  Little more than a year after the scandal broke, however, Folsom had found a new calling—and new credentials—in the Society of Scientific and Religious Truthseekers, where she offered weekly lectures and psychic demonstrations.

More so than the left, the right tends to be concerned about the excesses of democracy and a turn toward mob rule. To conservatives, the U.S. Constitution is admired and revered largely because it places checks on the publics passions, ensuring order and stability. According to conservative intellectuals, excessive flattery of the common people, and vilification of the elite, can lead a nation down a path that ends with the guillotine and devastation; the unchecked masses are more than a threat to the power of existing elites; unrestrained and led by a demagogue, they can threaten the basic stability that a society needs to flourish. On the other hand, American conservatism also seeks to be a mass movement, and the nature of representative democracy precludes too much open elitism. To secure elections, the Republican Party has to praise its base. For the most part, the conservative movement seems to understand this, and some prominent conservative journalists and intellectuals have embraced populist rhetoric. Conservatism has, often successfully, branded itself as a common sense ideology with plain-old-folks appeal. In this paper, I will consider the historical relationship between populism and conservatism, primarily focusing on elite conservative media. I argue that the conservative movement never successfully resolved this tension, and William F. Buckleys failure to complete The Revolt Against the Masses (which he expected to be his magnum opus), can be viewed as a metaphor for this entire relationship.</p>","The Stillborn Revolt Against The Masses: Conservative Intellectuals And The Question Of Populism"

For the next 27 months, they conducted the most extensive national political debate in American history over the radio. The world events of September 1939 to December 1941 coincided with the flowering of the national radio networks in the United States. The overwhelming majority of Americans had access to a radio, and the still relatively new networks had managed to cover virtually the entire country. Momentous events coincided with a previously unattainable ability for the average American to listen directly to a wide variety of voices proposing an impressive range of opinions.By the late 1930s, the radio was no longer the luxury item it had been as recently as 1930. By 1940, 90% of the people in urban areas outside the South had radios (in Southern urban areas, the rate was 79%).  Among urban whites, radio ownership was nearly universal: 94.4%.  Rural areas, not surprisingly, had somewhat lower ownership rates, but overall, the vast majority of Americans by 1940 had radios and lived in places covered by the three national networks (NBC, CBS, and Mutual). Both sides in the debate therefore came increasingly to see radio as a key medium for persuading public opinion. That competition spurred the development of ever-more sophisticated ways for political groups to use the medium of radio for political purposes. What began with standard political speeches by prominent speakers like FDR and former president Herbert Hoover came to include an impressive cross-section of elite opinion: not just the president and former president, not just members of Congress, but university presidents and professors, business and labor leaders, military officers and diplomats, journalists and commentators. Even more significantly, the need to shape public opinion led both sides to pursue ever-more sophisticated media strategies. They engaged each other in on-air policy debates. They produced special programs, sometimes with high production values. They incorporated fund-raising pleas into their programs. They put on extravaganzas featuring Hollywood and radio celebrities. Both America First and the Committee to Defend America recorded speeches (known then as transcriptions) and distributed them widely to local radio stations not affiliated with the national networks in order to extend their reach. In short, they revolutionized how political groups used the radio.In line with the theme of the 2018 conference, this presentation will make extensive use of audio clips from relevant radio programs and images culled from multiple archives to support the argument.</p>","The Air War: How The Great Debate Over World War II Revolutionized Politics On The Radio"

On the one hand investment dollars from across the globe were ready to flood San Diego in a quest to develop an international city. Yet, there was considerable pushback from citizens who did not want to see Americas Finest City become another Los Angeles. As was the case in many anti-growth revolts of the period, the central fear involved visons of a smog-filled, traffic-laden, urban hellscape. For San Diego, the fear was heightened by proximity to the border. In the minds of many citizens, the more the city grew the more the sieve-like conditions of the border would negatively impact quality of life in San Diego (mainly via drugs and crime). Then mayor at the time Pete Wilson, cut his political teeth as a young city councilmen by stoking fears of the border and immigration. Therefore, he was uniquely qualified to thread the needle of conservative politics in the period by on the one hand pushing for more cross-border capitalist development while also providing psychological comfort for his constituents by cracking down on crime. This formula became a keystone of neoliberal politics for advancing a new economy that was dependent on globalized development and labor markets while also providing meat to middle-class voters concerned about their place in the new global order. </p>","Threading The Needle:  Pete Wilson, The Border, And The Politics Of The New Economy In 1970s San Diego"

This paper critically examines the alliance between Nairobi and Venceremos, beginning with its inception at the College of San Mateos Third World Liberation Front strike in 1968 through the Colleges demise in the 1970s. In contrast to the more renowned San Francisco State and University of California, Berkeley Third World struggles, Nairobi and Venceremos viewed self-determination as only achievable apart from the apparatus of a state-operated university. The Colleges also viewed their struggle for self-determination as emanating from and interconnected with racially- and economically-oppressed communities in the Peninsula, adopting the slogan, The community is the campus.Not only did the Colleges operate primarily out of existing community institutions, including libraries, churches, and even residents homes; they also directed their resources and student body toward work to improve the conditions of their communities, from free health care clinics and food distribution to re-entry programs and drug rehabilitation, even extending to local labor solidarity. Yet tensions mounted as the Colleges priorities diverged. Nairobi eventually focused solely on creating avenues for upward socioeconomic mobility for East Palo Altans while Venceremos pursued fomenting imminent armed revolution to the United States. The histories of Nairobi and Venceremos Colleges thus offer an illustration of the tenuousness of alliances stretched between social contexts and through evolutions in ideology and praxis.</p>","To Serve Community And Campus: Nairobi And Venceremos Colleges And Third World Alliances For Self-Determination In The San Francisco Peninsula"

When questionaed about Indian dress students describe clothing made from animal skins. These prevailing stereotypes can be interdicted by introducing hands-on learning into and especially, outside the classroom. Direct experience at nearby museums allows student to see  different pieces of Indian clothing where they can hold and examine the eighteenth-century items worn by Indians.

In an amazing process of self-discovery, motivated by looking at and handling objects, students soon understand that there were many Indians living in the Great Lakes frontier, that this was not a vacant wilderness, that Indians dressed elegantly in European trade cloth because of the fur trade, and that Indian prosperity was evident from the hundreds of silver ornaments that they wore at one time.

I take as a case study a wounded Confederate soldier who wrote his fiancée a series of letters that detailed his favorable response to a popular British domestic novel that he had read in camp while awaiting a medical review boards decision on whether he was fit for active duty. With this soldier were 900 men who faced a similar fate. The soldier was not hopeful. Rarely is one found sufficiently afflicted with the wills that flesh is heir to to entitle him to a clear discharge, he explained. This has now become the great limbo of deformed and crippled humanity. As the references to Hamlet and to an essay by Joseph Addison suggest, the soldier understood that desperate men take desperate action. That had been most graphically evidenced by three recent suicide attempts in camp. All three men had slit their throats; one had succeeded in killing himself. The others would recover. Oh! the untold misery that follows war, he added. It destroys body, mind and soul. As he penned the letter, a fourth man successfully committed suicide. The juxtaposition of these conversations – one about wars destruction, the other about the sentiment aroused by this soldiers reading of a domestic novel – illuminates one of readings myriad functions during wartime, namely its purported ability to connect soldiers with their people back home.</p>","Transcending The Mountain Of Human Misery: Epistolary Conversations About Books During Wartime"

Alongside scholars such as James Sweet, Stephanie Camp, and Jason Young this piece shows how African survivals, especially concerning olfactory medicine and animal spiritualism, offered Africans in the New World spaces to assert their own forms of identity. These olfactory and symbolic responses were hard to identify and troublesome to white planters who could not perceive the olfactory complexity of African cultures because they asserted African odors as a simple biological inferiority. Thus, African slaves uses of odor and animals through Obeah, Candomble, Santeria, and voodoo rituals became hidden transcripts to which the elites of colonial culture were partially anosmiac, due to their stereotypical racist olfactory binaries. African medical practitioners did not desire such anosmia in their religious devotion and medical practices. African retention of the idea of smelling-out witches, poison, and disease and using animals as ephemeral portals within rituals survived the Middle Passage in nearly all American slave societies. African slaves used these ideas about animals and odors as a way to mark their own territory against their masters. This setting of rival geographies through smell, ritual, and animals constitutes a structural marker of revolutionary agency. </p>","Transgressive Animals, African Survivals, And The Sensory Worlds Of Obeah"

Many scholars have pointed out that by the late 1950s televisions had created a new enchanted sensibility among Americans, and they have argued (as Manuel Castells has) that this new culture of real virtuality transformed make-believe into belief in the making.  In this paper I investigate how televisions made imagined worlds of make-believe—including, for instance, heavenly afterlife worlds—into realities that seemed believable.  I do this by examining two different developments in the 1950s and 1960s:  1) how television producers of scifi anthology programs such as One Step Beyond and The Twilight Zone depicted televisual spaces themselves as real otherworldly spaces; and 2) how Christian televangelists used televisions to show that invisible electrical/spiritual forces could be transmitted between believers and from heavenly levels to earthly ones.  In these cases and in others, new American televisions were much more than objects that, once purchased, provided entertainment or escape; they also created an enchanted, spiritual imagination that made otherworldly spaces and disembodied presences seem closer, more real and more believable.</p>","Tuning The Invisible:  Televisual Transmissions Of Other Worlds And Disembodied Spirits"

Specifically, the Unemployed Councils of the Communist Party, USA serve as an oft-cited example of urban restlessness and the collective power of unemployed workers. Yet in Chicago in 1931, jobless workers created an economically mainstream version of the CPUSA Unemployed Councils, called the Workers Committee on Unemployment (WCOU). Through the WCOU – 20,000 strong at its height – unemployed workers publicized the plight of the unemployed, demanded an end to the demoralizing casework system, and called on the Illinois state government to increase relief funds for the city. Rather than calling for an overhaul of American capitalism, members of the WCOU did all of this in partnership with moderate reformers in the city: settlement house workers, pastors, and leaders in the Urban League.This paper examines the relationship between the WCOU and city reformers, and highlights moments when they intersected with members of the citys Communist Party Unemployed Councils. WCOU records, public hearing transcripts, and meeting minutes from their reformer allies reveal how these unemployed workers negotiated the rocky terrain of Depression-era work and survival. Together, unemployed workers and urban reformers simultaneously exploited fears of radicalism and distanced themselves from communism, all to lay claim to federal relief and decent work.</p>","Unemployed Workers, Urban Reformers, And The Fate Of Capitalism In 1930s Chicago"

From 1918 to roughly 1942 the Bay Area outing program recruited thousands of Native women from U.S. boarding schools to work as maids in affluent homes across the region. In exchange for room and board and meager wages, Native women cooked, cleaned and lived in the private homes of their employers. Through this program, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) pursued its goal of assimilation: to supplant Native values and traditions with western substitutes. This plan of assimilation through domesticity was a tool of the settler colonial project.This paper argues that Native women domestic workers negotiated and challenged federal assimilation strategies. The lens I employ focuses on the surveillance and monitoring of Native women and the choices and decisions they were obliged to consider. This paper exposes the settler colonial mechanics of the outing program while interrogating the following: within the confines of domestic labor how did Native women comply, resist and negotiate their circumstances? How did Native women rework into these systems, potential and possibility? How did they resist or unsettle the production of federal Indian policy? To this end I examine secondary sources, federal Indian policy, BIA records, never-before analyzed historic newspaper articles and oral history interviews that expose the gendering processes at work in government boarding school curriculum. I first historicize the program and then analyze archival records through two scales; at the macro level through BIAs Relocation, Training and Employment Assistance archival records that examine the programs larger structural framework, and at the micro level with 20th-century articles from the Berkeley Daily Gazette, the San Francisco Call and the Oakland Tribune that reveal the on the ground, local consequences of the program. These latter texts reveal a specific, localized rhetoric that sought to justify the control of Native women. Woven through this analysis are interviews that speak to the training of Native womens bodies through government boarding school instruction. In total, I illuminate the subtle and overt ways Native women resisted and unsettled the policies meant to control them.</p>","Unsettling Domesticity: Native Women Derailing U.S. Indian Policy In The San Francisco Bay Area, 1918 – 1936 "

The urban reinvestment movement, a nation-wide multiracial coalition of low- and moderate-income urbanites, scored important victories that increased the flow of fair bank loans to capital-starved neighborhoods during the close of the twentieth century. Most importantly, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977 created new banking regulations that pushed banks to finance resident-initiated, small-scale redevelopment—building homes on vacant lots, renovating old buildings, and rehabbing rental housing.This paper explores how urbanites deployed the CRA to increase affordable housing opportunities during the late 1970s and 1980s. The CRA codified a banks affirmative obligation to lend in low-income communities outside their offices, and federal bank regulators depended on activists to enforce the law by blowing the whistle on noncompliant banks. However, regulators dependence on community groups produced mixed results. On the one hand, this strategy allowed local reinvestment activists to win tailored lending programs with specific neighborhood credit needs in mind. On the other hand, local community-bank partnerships produced only a small supply of affordable housing compared to the overall need. At a time when Reagan-era spending cuts eliminated other resources for low- and moderate-income urbanites, community-bank agreements through the CRA thus became an important but imperfect tool for city residents who sought to improve their neighborhoods. </p>","Urbanites Fight For Capital During 1980s Financial Deregulation"

I argue that policies and practices we call Jim Crow also arose in the North American Southwest beginning in the eighteenth century and developed within successively Spanish, Mexican, and American intercultural communities. Without recourse to chattel slavery as a touchstone for social, political, and economic relations, people in the Southwest developed institutions that defined and differentiated racial hierarchies; that sponsored unfree labor and imprisonment for profit; and that relied on legal and extralegal violence to impose social and spatial segregation. Settlers on New Spains northern frontier chose these techniques to distinguish themselves from and to subjugate indigenous populations; Spanish-Mexicans and immigrant European Americans reworked and amplified these policies during the Mexican (1822-1846) and American (1848-) periods. Together, they controlled labor with anti-vagrancy laws and chain-gangs, restricted Indians, Mexicans, and Chinese to rancherias, barrios, and Chinatowns, and lynched Indians, Mexicans, Chinese, and Blacks. Rupturing Jim Crows geography and chronology resurfaces North American landscapes of society, politics, and labor past and present and suggests new research questions: On what knowledge did Southern Whites rely when developing what we now call Jim Crow? Did the Southwest provide a model, and did a direct transfer of knowledge take place? Addressing Jim Crows long shadow requires a reckoning of its compound, multiregional origins and its multiracial history. </p>","West Of Jim Crow: A Conceptual And Empirical Framework"

This paper analyzes the 1974 arrest of lay midwife Kate Bowland, charged with practicing medicine without a license, and the resulting case decided by the state supreme court, Bowland v. Municipal Court (1976). Citing Roe v. Wade, feminist defense attorney Ann Flower Cumings argued that childbirth was not a disease and therefore did not require licensed medical supervision or state regulation.  But the court disagreed.  Roe had never been interpreted so broadly as to protect a womans choice of the manner and circumstances in which her baby is born – indeed, the states interest in the life of the unborn child supersedes the womans own privacy right.  In the context of birth, Roe became a vehicle to constrain reproductive rights, rather than expand them.  Drawing on the personal papers of Kate Bowland, legal proceedings, organizational records, correspondence, and media coverage, I present the Bowland case as a critical moment in the history of childbirth and reproductive rights.</p>","When Legal Mechanisms Fail: Midwifery, Medicine, And The Law In 20th C.

From the gendered images of fat Texans consuming big gulps of soda in Super Size Me, which targeted the food industry and those who succumbed to the lure of fast food, to threats that insurers would drop overweight enrollees because they were causing their own bad health, obesity had taken on ominous, gendered connotations that surpassed matters of individual health and nutrition. The First Lady brought heart and resources to her promotion of healthy choices and changes in school lunch programs. Fifty years ago, political attention to obesity focused foremost on malnutrition among the nations poorest, particularly women suffering from food deprivation that was caused not by wrong-headed diets but their inability to access nutritious food. This paper analyzes the politics of hunger that erupted following its rediscovery during a 1967 tour of prominent senators, including Robert F. Kennedy, in Mississippi. Before obesity was politically uncoupled from poverty, documentary photographers and broadcasters publicized images of both emaciated children and obese mothers. While physicians testified about the bloated bodies of women subsisting on starchy foods, productions such as CBSs 1968 Hunger in America interviewed pregnant women unable to heed their doctors admonitions to stop gaining weight and eat fresh foods. This history and its potential significance today is the subject of this paper.</p>","When Obesity Was A Matter Of Poverty, Not Individual Responsibility  "

Using Louisiana law as a case study, I argue that the law demonstrates the fantasies that lawmakers—white, slaveholding men—projected onto their society. In other words, legal doctrine was a tool that lawmakers used to define and shape the society, making it more a metric of their hopes (and fears) than a lens on the reality on the ground.Even if doctrine like Louisianas Black Code/Code Noir (1807) indexed the social fantasies of lawmakers, this talk will show that it remains a useful tool for unearthing the lives of enslaved and free people of color. I locate an opportunity for telling black stories in the fissures between the doctrine and case law (that is, the practice of the law). It was in the courtroom that enslaved and free people of color brought the law to task, pushing on and occasionally cracking open the sliver of opportunity it provided; this talk will use the example of Barclay v. Sewell (1857) to show the crafty way that one woman of color reinvented the legal category of wife to retain her freedom in just this way. Thus where the archives of legal doctrine and case law interact, it is possible to see how white law could be remade by black actors, thus shining a light on black stories in spite of the whiteness of the source. </p>","White Fantasies, Black Stories: The Legal Archive Of African American History"

In the context of the &quot;second slavery,&quot; these regions became the world&quot;s largest suppliers of coffee and cotton, consolidating themselves as areas of economic expansion, closely connected with the European capitalist market and slave labor. In both places, this process was accompanied not only by the increase of the slave trade, but also by the strengthening of a wealthy class benefited from the profits generated by slavery and the sale of primary genres on a large scale.  The big house had a significant importance in these plantation areas. It was a place where members of the wealthy class worked to keep their heritage, honor and family wealth. However, it was also an area where a variety of domestic slaves - cooks, valets, maids, housekeepers, nannies, wet nurses - fought to build spaces of survival, even if fragile, within the slave institution. Therefore, big houses combined public and private spheres; they put together feelings of intimacy and affection with hard labor relations, power and hierarchy.  As sources, this analysis uses inventories, wills and lists of captives (such as the 1872 Official Brazilian Slaves list and the US censuses) related to big masters and crosses them with other documents such as personal letters, diaries, notebooks narratives and photographs in order to understand how violent and unbalanced were the relations between masters and domestic slaves inside the household. </p>","Who Are They?

Honduras suffered under the control of the United Fruit Company, whose business model depended on the complete submission of workers to the whims of corporate owners.  During the 1960s, however, a glimmer of hope emerged when a new corporate executive, Eli Black, led a successful takeover of United Fruit.  Black, an ordained rabbi and Polish immigrant, increased Honduran wages, provided free electricity to workers, and made it possible for employees to become homeowners.  Seen as a precursor to the socially conscious capitalist of today, Black tried to reverse years of exploitation and change the image of the United States abroad. The experiment did not last as economic volatility, political turmoil, and environmental catastrophe doomed his reform efforts in the 1970s.  What started as a noble dream ended in tragedy when Black took his own life.

The institution of slavery resulted in Black women working side by side with Black men during slavery.  Blacks, regardless of gender were barred from educational opportunities throughout the slave South and segregated in Jim Crow schools until the Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision of 1954. The belief in the notion of race uplift – that all Blacks were obligated to help one another –  was one that imbued in the race. Blacks valued and encouraged education for both boys and girls, and established coeducational schools.   Because of the shared experiences of all Blacks, most of the scholarship on their lives has focused until the past decade, primarily on race.  However, as the feminist concept and theory of intersectionality has emerged in foundational work by Patricia Hill Collins and Kimberly Crenshaw, scholars are now exploring how issues of gender, social class and sexuality have also impacted Black experiences.   This presentation explores how intraracial sexism impacted Black women and girls from the late nineteenth century through the Civil Rights era of the 1960s.  Sexism within the Black community was coined Jane Crow by Pauli Murray, activist feminist lawyer and Episcopal priest to describe her experience as a female student in the overwhelmingly male Howard University Law School in Washington, DC. during the 1940s.  Murray had eagerly gone to the Black Howard Law School because it was the training ground for renown black civil rights attorneys.  However, Murray experienced unexpected sexism while attending the Law School  - not being able to attend male smokers and barred from joining the  all-male Law professional organization.   However, these gender slights were not unique to Murray, as early as the late nineteenth century, Black women began to comment on gender distinctions within the race.  The passage of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 which granted Black men the right to vote was the first legal distinction made between Black men and women.  As a result, by 1900 twenty-two black men had served in the Nations Congress and scores of others had been elected to state and local government positions.  The privilege of voting resulted in many Black men totally embracing patriarchal notions of manhood. In 1892, Black feminist educator Anna Julia Cooper, raised the issue of sexism within the Black community her book A Voice from the South, noting that black men had fully internalized the role of Victorian men.  The way Black women addressed these issues will be analyzed.</p>","Writing About 'Jane Crow' Instead Of 'Jim Crow"

Singer settled nearby, became part of a vibrant world of female psychoanalysts, set up a private practice, and stayed in the UK for the rest of her life.  Her own work as a therapist, teacher, and public intellectual, focused on the study of childhood trauma, no doubt influenced by Anna Freuds work with child survivors of the Blitz.Writing a biography of Singer will require taking stock of her career (she was the first black psychoanalyst in the UK), as well as sifting through a rich set of contradictory tales she created out of her own history.

Dubbed the Commission for Border Development and Friendship (CODAF) by American and Mexican diplomats, this organization immediately incited the AFL-CIOs opposition. CODAF attracted bipartisan support across the borderlands, but it was no match for an unlikely coalition of Republican congressmen and labor leaders, who joined ranks and terminated CODAFs funding in 1972. This episode in borderlands history provides an interesting case study for the importance of the U.S.-Mexico border and its impact on national political coalitions. As such it sheds light on a crucial moment in American political and labor history by narrating how labor unions turned away from the Democratic Party and sought support from Republican legislators in their attempt to prevent what they called the exportation of American jobs. </p>","A Clutch For Bilingual Bureaucrats: Runaway Plants And The Rise And Fall Of The Commission For Border Development And Friendship, 1966-1972"

Founded in New York City in 1985, Gods Love was premised upon the uncontroversial notion that food was love, a tangible offering of nourishment and care.Today it is an enormously successful nonprofit with a multimillion dollar budget, delivering meals to people incapacitated by a range of illnesses. But the program gained its initial momentum by offering New Yorkers an outlet for expressing empathy regardless of their spiritual or political views --or lack thereof. In its mission and messaging, Gods Love was distinct from the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) and other contemporary organizations: it avoided referencing social justice, righteous anger, finding solutions, and appealing to the government. Instead, its aim was to help ordinary people be of service and thus to find joy and meaning. Such a strategic, individualistic approach enabled Gods Love to amass a broad and varied set of supporters who acted as board members, donors, staff, and volunteers.This paper explores the politics of volunteerism in a context of state retrenchment. By proffering the image of the suffering hungry person who needed help in the simplest, most direct way possible, the ideology of service positioned individual acts of kindness channeled through a private nonprofit as an antidote to the states neglect of people with AIDS.</p>","An Opportunity To Get In On That Joy: Food And Service At Gods Love We Deliver"

According to a prevailing mythology about race in our country, that puts the city far beyond the geographic center of racial violence, residential segregation, labor market segmentation, and other past and present manifestations of racism against African Americans.  The grip of this mythology was on full display in Duluth during the summer of 1920, when local whites expressed anguish and surprise after the lynching of three black circus workers there.  Even chief of police John Murphy, who was criticized for not adequately protecting the men while they were in jail, claimed at the time that he and a fellow detective didnt think anything would happen in this part of the country, that if it were down South it might.  Tellingly, Murphy made the claim during public court testimony in which he liberally littered his account of events with the word nigger, as did many other whites called to the stand.  But that was the least of it.  By engaging the panel session audience in an interactive guided encounter with several different sources—muck-racking newspaper articles, minstrel show advertisements, lynching photographs, and oral history transcripts—this paper will suggest just how deeply rooted and pervasive racism was in Duluth before and after the lynchings.  In this way, it will also offer a compelling case against northern racial exceptionalism. </p>","Didnt Think Anything Would Happen In This Part Of The Country:  Rediscovering The Racism Behind The 1920 Lynchings In Duluth, Minnesota"

However, despite this wide array of countries, historians tend to privilege the experiences of Confederate exiles in Brazil and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom and Canada. Given the proximity of Mexico to many southern states, particularly the Gulf South states, the relative lack of attention to the rebels who slipped across the Rio Grande to make a new life in Mexico is puzzling.

This paper, builds on his analysis and highlights men like Judge John Perkins, Henry Watkins Allen, and Nathaniel Beverley Tucker, among others.

First published by the New York headquarters of the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born (ACPFB) in 1959 as part of a petition to the United Nations protesting the treatment of the Mexican immigrant in the United States, this rather extraordinary document was the product of long collaboration between immigrant rights organizers on East and West coasts. Its repurposing by CASA indicates the persistence of this collaboration across time as well as space. The border-spanning prose of Our Badge of Infamy emanated from the multi-racial solidarity of the Popular Front.  The repurposing of this pamphlet by CASA, an organization central to the florescence of the Chicanx movement on the West Coast, evidences the historical trajectory of immigrant rights advocacy.  Historians have tended to think about the Old and New Lefts separately;  it is as if a historiographical 98th meridian divides class- and party- oriented multi-ethnic internationalism from the race, ethnicity and gender identity-based anti-colonialism of the New Social Movements. But the transmission of Our Badge of Infamy across this divide suggests that the ACPFB defied this divide by straddling it. Though as a Popular Front- allied organization the ACPFB suffered repression during the height of the Cold War , it survived  because the organizations critique of police power and its defense of the rights of the foreign-born remained imperative and generative.  </p>","Our Badge Of Infamy, The United Nations And The Long Arc Of Immigrant Rights"

How might the oral history process itself influence subjects to reconsider their reluctance to talk about sexual secrets?  What, then, does the historian make of stories that have been told off the record, and how do those accounts influence our interpretations of our subjects&quot; lives and times? What do we do with sexual secrets that have been revealed &quot;off the record&quot; by oral history subjects? Within the course of interviews, when and why do subjects rethink their decisions about sexual silences? This paper explores these questions through excerpts from two interviews conducted during the 1990s: in one, an initial self-censorship gave way within the course of the interview process to a later acknowledgment of a childhood sexual trauma; in the other, the revelation several years after the interview of an untold component of a sexual relationship revised the interpretation of the story and of the subjects coming of age narrative. The paper attempts to open a conversation about patterns in sexual self-censorship and revelation in oral histories, particularly about sexual trauma, as well as to consider how historians can balance respect for our subjects&quot; sexual privacy without reinforcing self-censorship. </p>","'Turn Off The Tape': Dilemmas Of Sexual Silences In Women's Oral History"

Although disease outbreaks were common at the overcrowded and underfunded Indian school, this year was different: within a few months, more than a third of the student body was hospitalized and at least nine students died. The students suffered from a virulent and deadly new strain of influenza—one which traveled the globe in the lungs of soldiers and civilians dislocated by the First World War and killed approximately two percent of the worlds population. The effects of the pandemic—the deadliest in recorded history—were magnified at Haskell by personnel shortages among agency staff and medical professionals as well as by overcrowding that resulted from the closure of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania since many of those students transferred to Haskell just in time for the second wave of the pandemic. This paper traces the course of the influenza pandemic at Haskell and examines its consequences for students, their families, and school officials. By laying bare this institution during a moment of crisis, the pandemic provides a window on the administration of Indian boarding schools during the early twentieth century, how government officials introduced modern sanitation and medical practices to Native students, the relationships between students, parents, and agency staff, and the responsibility the federal government as guardian had to its Indian wards during the period before Indians were officially granted U.S. citizenship in 1924. </p>","A Very Serious And Perplexing Epidemic Of Grippe: Sickness, Suffering, And Survival At The Haskell Institute During The Influenza Pandemic Of 1918-1919"

This traditional nationally-centered focus on domestic political battles, however, obscures an important paradox: at the very moment that the New Deal state was most in flux at home, US global power was reshaping social governance abroad, and in some cases left reforms that exceeded what was politically possible in the US. This paper seeks to fill this gap by examining the largely untold story of social security reform during the 1945 – 1952 US occupation of Japan. Drawing on previously untapped government records, memoirs, and personal collections, I trace the activities of the Social Security Division within the occupation, which was staffed with a cadre of young and idealistic officers, many with experience in the Social Security Administration and other New Deal agencies. They saw Japan as a technicians dream, a social tabula rasa onto which they could project their vision of universal, comprehensive social insurance and social assistance. Directly supported and advised by experts from the Social Security Administration like Arthur Altmeyer and Isadore Falk, the officers of the Social Security Division demilitarized Japanese social policy, instituted new forms of social assistance, enshrined social security as a right in the 1947 constitution of Japan, and recommended an integrated, compulsory social security system that would integrate health insurance; many of these reforms exist to this day. Although these administrators and officers (often explicitly) sought to institute reform that was becoming increasingly untenable at home, they could not long escape domestic battles over social policy in the US. In 1947, they came under congressional investigation on charges that they were attempting to foist universal healthcare on the unwilling Japanese people. The next year, the American Medical Association sent a highly publicized mission to Japan to recommend private, voluntary, employer-based healthcare on the then-emerging American model. Occupied Japan thus became an unlikely proxy battleground for US policy debates. The result, I show, helped to shape the trajectory of social policy in both Japan and the US. Ultimately, this story cuts to the heart of what sorts of social rights that both public and private US actors would seek to espouse and impose at the dawn of the Cold War and US global power. It helps to challenge outmoded, unexamined assumptions about US social policy exceptionalism: rather than looking at what didnt emerge politically in the postwar US, I instead examine the ways US global power did shape social-political landscapes abroad. It also shows that social policies can flow across national boundaries not only through transnational exchange of models, but also through conquest, coercion, and uneven balances of power. </p>","An Obligation To Build Anew: The Politics Of Social Security Reform In The Us Occupation Of Japan, 1945 – 1952"

Numerous branches of the Partido Liberal Mexicano espoused Magonismo ideas about worker dignity, livable wages, and women&quot;s rights and began to dot the landscape along the border in the early 1900s. These ideas were expressed in the numerous uprisings during the Mexican Revolution of 1910.

Among these women was Caritina Piña, who served as the head of correspondence. While the historiography on Mexican (and Mexican American) anarchism has focused mainly on Mexican male actors in the production of anarcho-syndicalist thought, women such as Caritina Piña directly sustained the global labor movement through her active role in spreading ideology while she developed a transnational network of women that helped to produce knowledge about the movement itself.

Yet, by exploring transnational medical debates over the causes of yellow fever in the 1790s, this paper argues that physicians played a crucial role in weakening the transnational abolitionist movement at the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1795, a proslavery British physician, Dr. Colin Chisholm, argued that the recent yellow fever outbreaks in Philadelphia, New York, and the West Indies stemmed from a contaminated ship coming back from Sierra Leone, the newly established abolitionist colony.  At the time, abolitionists in both the United States and Britain hoped that Sierra Leones success would prove that paying Africans to cultivate cash crops on their own continent would obviate the need of slave labor in the West Indies and southern United States.  Chisholms theory thus tainted Sierra Leone and the broader abolitionist movement for which it stood. Abolitionist-physicians in the United States published lengthy refutations of Chisholms theory in the nations leading medical journals, highlighting its blatant anti-abolitionist agenda. Yet their abolitionist-physician allies in Britain were decidedly more muted, suggesting that national politics formed a powerful antidote to a movement that functioned best with a united transnational front.  Of course, many reasons explain the failure of the abolitionist movement in the 1790s. But the role medical science played in shaping its fate demands greater attention.</p>","Antislavery Science: Yellow Fever And The Failure Of The Abolitionist Movement In The 1790s"

Historians have argued that Pentecostal interest in American politics is a recent development and side-effect of their proximity to evangelical Christians. Pentecostals began as apolitical members of society, the logic goes, but they as showed an interest in middleclass respectability, they took on evangelical and fundamentalist approaches to social and political engagement. Indeed, the notion that early Pentecostal practitioners were apolitical or Anabaptist in their initial approach to politics is a truism in the study of Pentecostalism and American religious history. Scholars of global Pentecostalism (in particular students of Latin American Pentecostalism) critique this claim, but the idea that Pentecostals in the United States began as apolitical endures in scholarly and popular descriptions of the movement. This paper surveys twenty-six prominent English and Spanish language Pentecostal publications in the United States from 1890-1930 on the subject of women in the public sphere to demonstrate that, from their inception, Pentecostals were politically-minded. These theological and political conversations about the place of women in (or out of) American society and in (or out of) the pulpit illuminate how politics shape(d) the trajectory of Pentecostalism (and vice versa). I hope to conclude by discussing how viewing the early Pentecostal movement as political from the outset can enrich historians understanding of the relationship between politics and religion in the United States. </p>","Bobbing The Hair And Other Masculinated Sins:  Women, Pentecostals, And Politics In The United States From 1890-1930."

A former contractor turned community organizer in the late 1960s, Scott blossomed as an activist at a time when Black Nationalists increasingly demanded community control of construction jobs in Seattle.  In sharp contrast to historical accounts that link Black Power to racial separatism, this paper examines a unique moment in Scotts political development, one that clearly demonstrated his openness to multiracial solidarity.  By drawing upon a rich archive of publications and poetry that Scott produced in the mid 1970s, I unpack an analogue that Scott continually referenced throughout his writing and speeches: the New Buffalo Soldier.  In both his writings and speeches, Scott likened Black activists narrowly concerned with their own racial group as yet another manifestation of African American Soldiers who fought of the side of manifest destiny in the 1800s.  To give further context to Scotts analysis, this paper pays particular attention to his own history of military service in Okinawa and Vietnam, as well as his interactions with Native American activists in the American Indian Movement. In doing so, I link the study of the Black Power Era to that of U.S. Empire.  More precisely, I reveal the connections between Scotts Black radical imagination and his exposure to different histories of U.S. Colonialism: Imperial wars of aggression in the Asia-Pacific and the Red Power Movements confrontation with settler colonialism in the Pacific Northwest.  </p>","Buffalo Solider…We Must Now Refuse To Ride: U.S. Empire And The Tyree Scotts Black Radical Imagination"

While scholars have examined the possibilities and limits of laws and policies designed to make public spaces and employment opportunities more equitable, we know comparatively little about how particular laborers engaged desegregation or new protections from gender discrimination. Drawing on archival research and oral histories, Karissa Haugeberg investigates how nurses engaged the movement for racial justice in previously segregated American hospitals during the 1960s. This paper engages the panels theme of gender and conservatism by elucidating how members of the female-dominated nursing profession enacted and contested progressive public policies. On the eve of 1960, 94-percent of southern hospitals and 17-percent of northern hospitals remained segregated, either by refusing to admit African Americans altogether or by treating white and African American patients on separate wards. Over the course of the decade, hospital administrators, fearing litigation and the loss of federal money, responded to a host of public policies, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Social Security Amendments of 1965, by revising hiring practices and patient care. By placing professional women at the center of this study, Haugeberg seeks to reveal how ordinary Americans understood, enacted, or contested concepts of equality, obligation, and fairness, and also how social justice movements reconfigured the American workplace.</p>","Civil Rights On The Hospital Floor: American Nursing And Hospital Integration In The Deep South"

Slavery and capitalism studies link the removal of Indians from their ancestral homelands in the Southeast with the expansion of slavery in the Deep South.  On the other hand, less historical attention has been given to how Native American slaveholders contributed to the growth of the institution not only by their leaving, but also by their coming to the southwestern part of the United States. Therefore, considering Indian and black forced migrations in tandem, instead of as separate and pivotal traumatic events, can illuminate on topics such as Native American involvement in the market economy and how conceptions of blackness and notions of Native sovereignty and futurity formed, collided, and reconciled during the mid-19th century.Without considering bondpeoples forced removal to Indian Territory and other areas of the western United States, we have an incomplete understanding of chattel slaverys massive expansion during the antebellum period and of Native participation in this practice.

During the last third of the twentieth century, countless industries closed down their doors as Southern California joined the national shift from a Fordist to a Postfordist economy. A myriad of factories and the blue-collar white workers employed in their work floors, left the Los Angeles region during this time. Yet the population of the metropolis did not contract in size. In fact, Los Angeles continued to grow and solidified its status as the second biggest metropolitan region in the nation. The sustaining and growth of Los Angeles was driven by the arrival of thousands of migrants from Asia and Latin American. For members of the latter group, their migrations from Latin American were the product of the reshaping of the global economy that embraced neoliberal policies and domestic political turmoil attendant to Cold War conflicts.Cities such Huntington Park and South Gate South East Los Angeles, which were founded as white suburbs turned into Latina/o communities during the last third of the twentieth century.  The exodus of white residents resulted in a dilapidated municipal infrastructure and decaying public schools that proved ill-prepared to serve the new residents. In the absence of public spaces or youth-oriented establishments, by the late 1980s and early 1990s Latina/o youth began to host music shows in a number of improvised venues such as restaurants, quinceañera halls, auto shops, timeworn veterans hall, among other places. These gatherings featured bands part of a transnational music genre known as Rock en Español that combined British and American rock styles with Latin American sounds and gained massive popularity as a Pan Latin-American genre by the early 1990s. The appearance of these improntu venues was vehemently scrutinized by local government officials and police agencies as these often defied regulation or lacked the necesary permits to operate. Nonetheless, these ephemeral forums served as organizing spaces where youth developed local, regional, and transnational networks of communication in which information flowed multidirectionally. These networks produced enduring political participation among many of participants at different local, regional and transnational levels to denounce immigrant bashing electoral initiatives such as Proposition 187 in 1994, as well as succesful efforts to stave off the opening of polluting power plants in the city of South Gate in 1999, and to connect the transnational pro-democracy efforts in Mexico. Hence, this presentation will consider how the creation of youth-oriented Latina/o social spaces were part of collective actions within South East L.A. empowered residents to push back against structural marginalization, while proposing generative conceptions of participatory citizenship that include migrants (regardless of legal status) as part body politic of Southern California by the new millennium.</p>","Ephemeral Forums, Enduring Communities:  Latina/O Community Building And Belonging In 1990s South East Los Angeles"

Once prominently defined as the Hero of Gettysburg, Meade is now commonly obscured by the notoriety of Generals Grant and Sherman and Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas Stonewall Jackson.  This was not always the case, however.  When George Gordon Meade died on November 6, 1872, scores of fellow military personnel and grateful citizens wrote his family expressing their condolences and regret.  The ensuing years, and ultimately decades, brought forth a flurry of activity to memorialize and commemorate Pennsylvanias famed son.  In addition to the written narrative, Meades legacy emerged through another form of history, in the form of memorials on the commemorative landscape.  Ultimately Americans initiated efforts to place memorials to Meade at three prominent locations, Gettysburg National Military Park, the location of the generals most famed victory, Fairmont Park in Philadelphia, the generals hometown, and on the Capitol Grounds in Washington, D.C.  This paper seeks to highlight the prominent place that Meade held among his contemporaries and succeeding generations and in doing so reasserts the Hero of Gettysburg to his central, defining role in the Civil War and American memory.        </p>","His Fame Is Enduring: George Gordon Meade And The Shadows Of American Memory"

It will focus on the approach taken by Bruce Mohler, Director of the National Catholic Welfare Conferences Immigration Bureau, focusing on his attention to the separation of Maltese families as a result of restrictions imposed by the Immigration Act of 1924. Working at the frontlines of the new Restriction State, Catholic social activists were confronted by the consequences of a National Origins Quota System that made it extremely difficult for the wives and children of non-Citizen aliens from areas with small quota numbers to join their husbands and fathers in the U.S. Voluntary agency staff were best positioned to convey these realities to policymakers. In this context, Maltese authorities were granting passports only to those women and children whose husbands and fathers were already in the U.S. so as to give these individuals priority within the small quota allocated to this British Crown Colony. Mohler praised this policy that recognized the moral and humane needs of immigrant families in the U.S.  This paper shows how an important voice at the front lines of immigration restriction accepted, when necessary, corollary emigration restriction as an extension of the new American Restriction State. </p>","Moral And Humane Needs: Catholic Social Thought, Immigrant Families And The Restriction Of European Emigration In The 1920s"

Following the arrival of Europeans early in the sixteenth century, the Ais used these same maritime skills to acquire goods, peoples, and even parts of the shattered ships that then washed ashore.  The Ais flourished from this dynamic maritime economy that combined existing and novel uses of the materials available in the local Atlantic commons.  This multi-step strategy of indigenous wrecking remained remarkably stable over several centuries, as evident by comparing the 1571 and 1696 shipwrecks of Spaniard and St. Augustine founder Pedro Menéndez de Avilés with Anglo-Jamaican and later Philadelphian merchant Jonathan Dickinson.  Through their exploitation of these goods and peoples from European shipwrecks, coupled with their careful manipulation of Atlantic and indigenous contacts, the Ais polity established an expansive domain during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including influence in at least thirty-nine towns in east central Florida.  This Ais Domain, and the Ais themselves, disappeared in the eighteenth century.  Despite holding substantial sway in peninsula Florida for two centuries, this Ais Domain figures little in most Florida histories.  The Ais and many of their fellow indigenous Floridians are often a mere footnote of presence before they vanish.  This work, then, is an act of dual recovery, recovering the Ais Domain, which the Ais themselves forged through their recoveries from wrecks.</p>","Of All Who Have Ever Been Wrecked Here, On One Has Ever Escaped Death Or Capture: Indigenous Wrecking And The Post-Contact Rise Of The Ais"

The countrys constitutional Founding features prominently in scholarship, as well as in contemporary political discourse and strands of jurisprudence. But the origins of such investment in original visions, laden with expectations for political and legal legitimation, do not. This paper suggests that constitutional veneration was generatively conjoined with bitter conflict over slavery. The former was constitutive of the latter, while the framework of veneration structured debates over slavery under law.In antebellum American, the public learned to regard the Founding as a repository of authoritative visions, intentions and binding promises that prescribed terms of a national future. To negotiate the fraught politics of slavery, people celebrated, grasped for and wielded the cultural and legal power of the past against present crises. In doing so, Americans forged an emotional popular constitutional life defined by divisive reverence, one that crossed distinctions among jurisdictions, parties, race, gender and sentiment. The American public spoke a common constitutional vernacular, sharing rhetorical and conceptual practices: they invoked meanings, understandings, and values attributed to the Founding, and yet different communities articulated dramatically divergent narratives that left little room for compromise beyond those asserted to have once been made by national fathers. After a brief introduction on the production of constitutional reverence between the Treaty of Ghent (1815) and tariff nullification crisis (1831-33), this paper discusses the promulgation of clashing claims upon the Founding during the following decades. It argues that debates over slavery fostered public inculcation and rehearsal of reverence and deference to an authoritative constitutional past. Political movements exercised the Foundings power as a venerated object offensively to govern distant bodies and defensively to deflect others efforts to govern life close to home. Drawing from judicial, electoral and civic discourse, the paper illustrates how the Founding became a shield or sword in the hands of slaveholders, abolitionists, unionists and disunionists. It explains deployment of historically reverent constitutionalism to defend antislavery petitioning and press, slave state sovereignty and personal liberty laws; then it pivots to show opposing depictions of framers designs applied to slave rendition, commerce powers, and federal territories. These instances demonstrate the importance of constitutional veneration in tactics and consciousness; to denigrate the work of the national fathers was to cede legal-moral ground, as higher-law proponents and Constitution critics found. Efficacious movements located rallying cries within the spirit of revered fathers. Yet subjective visions meant that one communitys shield was anothers sword, dissonance that fueled polarization. By developing constitutional attachment as the heart of an ambiguous nationalism, conceiving that revolutionary fathers imparted authoritative meaning, extending that meaning to promises concerning slavery, people perceived a deeper constitutional treachery in opponents and heightened sanction for their own positions. By example, the paper makes the case for recognizing the role of slavery in galvanizing the development of American constitutional culture, and for reintegrating constitutionalism into the thick of cultural, intellectual and political scholarship on the early republic.</p>","Our Palladium Of Liberties: Slavery And The Weaponized Constitutional Founding, 1833-1860 "

The U.S. birth-rate had fallen by half since 1800, from 7 children per couple to around 3.5. Its apparent trajectory towards zero, the young president warned, promised to extinguish the American experiment. Roosevelts warning touched off a decades-long public debate during which thousands of Americans asked themselves whether small families were selfish, as Roosevelt claimed, or economically rational; whether they part of the good or bad in modernity; and whether a good person owed any reproductive debt to God, nature, tribe or nation.                This paper will examine the conservative side of this civic debate. Pro-natal conservatives saw in mass birth control a fatal paradox at the heart of American liberalism. The proud individualism that had built Anglo-America also threatened to tear it down, condemning its builders and their ideas to extinction. To avoid this fate, moralists asked their fellow Americans to rethink the strong cultural association of small families with modernity, rejecting the common assumption that each of those phenomena flowed benignly from the other, and demanding the subordination of modern comforts to the primitive and natural laws of existence. In the process they built a pro-natal mysticism, which asserted that the liberalism of rights—rather than duties—was fundamentally incompatible with human survival over time. This biological conservatism retains an enduring significance in global debates over reproductive ethics.</p>","Race Suicide And Procreative Mysticism In America, 1900-1940"

These new visions responded to the movement of ideas, print, bodies, and microbes, as Americans worked to understand the unexpected movement of a quick and merciless pandemic over the decades that followed. One important strain of this imagining connected the arrival and spread of cholera to the ills of racial slavery. As the initial arrival of cholera on the American continent (for the first time ever) came quickly on the heels of Nat Turners execution and the restrictive legislation that followed, prominent African Americans and abolitionists—including Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Martin Delany—saw the disease as moral retribution for the traffic in human bodies. This equation was certainly a powerful social, political, and rhetorical move, but it was also a medical one. In this paper I will focus on the work of Stowe and Delany to show how their understanding of cholera prompted them to craft a radical medical geography that upended prevailing theories of disease. </p>","Race, Cholera, And Radical Medical Geography"

Many former Peace Corps workers were at the forefront of efforts to embrace and manage diversity in education and in business and organizational life. Undergirding this movement were concepts of cultural sensitivity and inter-cultural communication that were first put into practice, on a wide scale, by the Peace Corps, which saw these as necessary skills for Americans navigating an increasingly globalized world. Why and how were ideas first deployed in the context of American foreign aid applied to the problem of social difference within the U.S.?The Peace Corps stressed the relativism of cultural norms at the same time that it sought to ensure U.S. hegemony in the so-called Third World. A similar conflict was built into domestic liberal multiculturalism—that of accommodating difference within the overriding framework of the nation. This paper will interrogate the motivations behind the concept of cultural sensitivity and explore how notions of state power influenced its theory and practice, at home and abroad. It will also look to Peace Corps volunteers themselves as agents of both foreign and domestic policy.

Marketed nationally as local entertainment, their nearly ten thousand published minstrel plays—which are the bedrock of my research—are revisionist political treatises documenting the material remnants of white supremacys intellectual life after the Civil War. More importantly to the methodological concerns of this panel, blackface shows, when produced in printed form during Reconstruction, were understood as intellectual documents that accurately represented black life and expressive culture authentically to white audiences who studied them to physically embody and perform a specific understanding of blackness. I will grapple with how contemporary readers understood them as authoritative studies of black life by placing them in conversation with other white produced documents they were based off of: fugitive slave ads detailing slaves musical and instrumental talents and ethnographic studies white actors made of slave life to re-appropriate on stage. </p>","Slave Tambos To The Life: Blackface Minstrelsys Intellectual Genealogy & Search For Authentic Slave Performance "

Promoters for both strove to counter negative perceptions of the region based on climate, geography, and regional history. Both continue, in the present day, to craft compelling historical narratives to brand themselves to tourists, businesses, and residents, and both are part of the national Main Street Center, which makes historic preservation a key element of development and revitalization. Contemporary efforts to market these spaces incorporate historical forms that shape downtown landscapes: murals, plaques, streetscapes, museums. The narratives they present resonate—and reproduce—those created by the earliest boosters. Both the contemporary stories and the historic templates they reference rely on a series of elisions and perspectives that mythologize elements of the past and elide complex or controversial histories related to race and class. In DeLand, contemporary historical narratives emphasize white pioneer stories, with only passing reference to the African Americans who labored in the areas turpentine and citrus industries. In Thomasville, Georgia, the revived Main Street and nearby neighborhoods restore the Victorian charm that, along with nearby plantations, is the towns tourism draw.

He hoped the American intervention would bring three figures of modern enterprise – the scientist, engineer, and practical economist – to the former colony to discover what the Philippines have to add to the useful productions of the world (156).

I argue that the perceived threat of communism helped make the two countries into stronger allies than in previous years. By 1964 and 1965, the Vietnam conflict had drawn the United States, militarily, into the region. Washington turned to Thailand as a base for U.S. air operations. My main argument for this period focuses on the USIS and Thai governments efforts to convince the people of the dangers of communism and its potentiality of growing in Thailand. U.S.-Thai public diplomacy officials portrayed Thai support for American military intervention in Vietnam as a national security necessity. Eventually in 1966, the United States requested the Thai government send a military contingency to Vietnam as part of Lyndon B. Johnsons rally around the flag campaign. The USIS and Thai military-monarchical government created public campaigns to develop support for Thailands involvement in the war.

But looking backward can also generate powerful models of progress and peace. In the mid-twentieth century black and white socialists seeking radical economic and social change drew from nineteenth-century utopian communities to model a new world in the present. These communities were, in a sense, a way to represent both the American past and its potential future. Pacifist communities created cooperative farms in the Deep South, urban Ashrams in the Northeast, and interracial churches on the West Coast. They promoted communal living, cooperative economics and a new form of radical pacifism that became an essential tool in the civil rights movement.Father Divine, for example, was particularly enamored with Mother Ann Lee and the Shakers. In 1936 he founded a series of rural interracial cooperatives, which he named the Promised Land, in a region of rural New York where the Shakers had begun their utopian experiment. Ashrams in Newark and Harlem in the 1940s modeled themselves after Gandhian communities, but also after early nineteenth century utopian societies such as Ephrata. And the Delta Cooperative farm in Mississippi was explicitly modeled after nineteenth-century Owenite cooperatives such as New Harmony. In these spaces activists lived communally and honed their skills in nonviolent direct action.

One conclusion from this cosmology of eternal matter was heretical: that no transcendent Creator-God existed.  Other heresies followed: Jesus was not divine; heaven and hell were inventions.  Dr. Phineas Hedges in New York State combined medical vitalism with such religious heresy.  His overt disregard for Christian beliefs provoked fear and loathing in his orthodox neighbors.  After Hedges and some friends engaged in a mockery of communion by offering a wafer to a dog, reports flew that the miscreants soon suffered the wrath of God.  When Hedges died unexpectedly in 1799, his opponents clucked and nodded in relief.  But in other ways Hedges was harder to dismiss.  His vitalism also supported his conception of the American Republic as an organic whole in which all people were kin.  Vitalist insights spurred generosity, Hedges maintained, and a virtuous Republic required such a radically increased benevolence.  Dr. Hedges was part of a small but headstrong community of people who braided together the concepts of vitalism, virtue, and irreligion in the early Republic.</p>","Benevolence Shall Gush In Limpid Streams From The Heart: Vitalist Science, Republican Virtue, And Religious Infidelity In The 1790s."

Grants upcoming visit to London. Pierrepont asked how Grant was to be received by the British elite and insisted that Grant receive the same consideration as the Ex-Chief Ruler of an Empire. Derby, noting that an ex-president had no diplomatic precedence in America, much less in Britain, observed that Once an Emperor always an Emperor. Pierrepont replied then, once a President always a President. For the first time a former American president was treated, not only as a statesman, but as a former head-of-state.  This episode highlights the uniqueness of Ulysses S. Grants post-presidential career. While former presidents had traveled abroad prior to Grants trip, none sought or received the reception afforded to Grant.  As his engagements with diplomatic elites grew in number, Grant found that his opinion on world matters carried weight.  By the end of his trip he believed that his experiences around the world had afforded him an opportunity to help expand the United States economic reach into the burgeoning Asian markets.  Grant immersed himself in the economic and political issues of the world, believing that his newfound knowledge would help him achieve a third term in the Executive Mansion.  This paper will argue that Grants world tour helped to lay the groundwork for United States imperialism in Asia, strengthened his claim for a third term, and buoyed the reputation of the American presidency worldwide.</p>","More For Our Country Than For Me: The Diplomatic Mission Of Ulysses S.

Like all previous Bureau Chiefs, Eliot was highly educated, unmarried and, like many of her Bureau colleagues, she maintained an intimate relationship with another woman.  As Chief, she worked closely with womens reform organizations.  Many of those groups had been in the forefront of Progressive and New Deal reform and their members vigorously defended Childrens Bureau interests.  Eliot, however, was the last chief to fit this model.  Although previous chiefs handpicked their successors, when Eliot resigned in 1957, she was replaced with Katharine Oettinger, who was recruited over the objections of Eliot and voluntary womens organizations.  During Oettingers tenure, the Childrens Bureau lost status and was dismantled in 1969.These setbacks, for Eliot, the Childrens Bureau, and aging women reformers, demonstrate how age, gender, and sexuality shaped the shift from Progressive and New Deal reform to Cold War liberalism.  Newspapers emphasized Eliots grandmotherliness, her unattractiveness, and her childlessness, perceptions that reflected assumptions about sexuality and age.  Other government welfare officials disparaged her as too aggressive in defending nostalgic ideas about public welfare.  In replacing her, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare made motherhood a job requirement and favored Oettinger because she promised to be a team player with liberal men in government.  Overall, Eliot was portrayed by colleagues and in public forums as a relic of an earlier era, an old woman with old ideas, blocking the path to modern, liberal reform.</p>","The Last Of The Dedicated Old Maids: Aging Maternalist Progressives In A Liberal Era"

Case in point is Asian American history, which began as a project of identity, inclusion, political empowerment, and social justice during the civil unrest of the 1960s. At the time, these shared objectives produced particular forms of history. Scholars penned community studies in order to recover lost experiences, wrote U.S.-centric narratives to combat earlier exclusions, and created public history exhibits to fight for restitution. But the past half-century has witnessed the rapid growth and fracturing of the field. Widespread institutionalization has begun to separate Asian American history from its political roots.  At one time the central tenets that inspired Asian American history were clear, but today this is no longer the case. Is Asian American history still driven by the particular politics of the present moment? Or is it inspired by new archives, intellectual frameworks and methodological trends? Does a belief in a shared past still hold the field together?  Or does it cohere around hope for a shared future? As the inspiration and intent of Asian American history has shifted, so too has its chosen genres, venues, and audiences. This roundtable will explore the connection between what informs historians work and what forms of history they choose to produce. Panelists will include Naomi A. Paik, author of Rightlessness: Testimony and Redress in U.S. Prison Camps since World War II (2016) and, recently, co-author of a collective statement by Asian American studies scholars regarding Japanese American Internment and a proposed registry of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries.

Lin-Manuel Mirandas musical about founding father, Alexander Hamilton, has resonated with its audience and the broader American public in ways unlike any other musical in American history. Since it opened in 2015, Hamilton has become a cultural, political, and historical phenomenon. This panel will bring together historians and cultural studies scholars—all of whom are contributors to the forthcoming volume, Historians on Hamilton—to explore and help explain the Hamilton phenomenon. Hamilton is perhaps the most popular historical representation in decades and it incredible success is very clearly linked to the way in which it tells the story of nations founding with hip-hop and rap music traditions performed by a largely non-white cast. Our panelists will explore a variety of questions. They will ask how Hamilton measures up as a work of history, especially important in light of the ways that the musical is being used to teach about the founding fathers and Americas racial past. To what extent does this musical offer a historically accurate representation of the past and what are the implications of its inaccuracies, its exclusions, and its emphasis on including ethnic players who were actually marginalized and enslaved at the time? What did Lin-Manual Miranda get right, what did he get wrong, and does it matter? Panelists will also engage with Hamilton as historical representation whose popularity not only has the potential to shape the way Americans understand their past, but also has much to tell us about a contemporary political moment. Indeed, Hamilton has found fans among both liberals and conservatives. Both Republicans and Democrats have advocated using Hamilton in American history classes. The panel will explore what about the form of this particular representation has allowed it to transcend the history wars that so commonly divide left and right in the U.S. Finally, the panel will offer a space to reflect on questions about narrative form, popular culture and historical truth. There is no question that Hamilton is profoundly ahistorical. Thomas Jefferson was not a black man who engaged in rap battles with a Puerto Rican Alexander Hamilton about the need for a national bank. And yet, do those rap battles and those multiracial casting point audiences to larger historical truths and possibilities than might a more historically accurate account of the Jefferson/Hamilton debate over economic policy in the early Republic? Can historical truths be revealed through consciously ahistorical forms? To what extent is Hamilton democratizing history, both reminding us—as was written recently on an early American history blog—that history does not belong only to those who study it for a living. If this musical is indeed a peoples history, how might Hamilton affect the ongoing efforts by historians to find ways to reach audiences outside the academy? And can this show offer us lessons as historians about how to teach history and to communicate the past in ways that engage young people and bring history alive for them?</p>","What Did I Miss?: Historians Discuss Hamilton"

The national traumas of the Vietnam War, Watergate, Wounded Knee, and environmental crises, left U.S. audiences feeling disenchanted with the trite narratives and images of American exceptionalism and ethnic chauvinism that traditionally defined the genre. In the last quarter of the 20th century, film makers occasionally revisited the format with critical and popular successes like Dances with Wolves (1990) and The Unforgiven (1992), but the dearth of titles led many observers to question the genres viability.    As a genre that once dominated U.S. popular culture, the Western has waned, but since 2000, producers have released a small yet persistent number of movies that exhibit the forms and conventions of that category. Within that limited group, the panelists for this session detect something evocative. When film makers choose to produce a Western in the 21st century, are they declaring their intention for social commentary, or are they simply exploiting some nostalgic impulse? Do they find resonance, or dissonance, between the old Forms of History and audiences living in a post-9/11 world, or facing genuine ecological peril, or searching for meaning in the anxious populism that culminated in the Election of 2016?The panelists will interrogate 21st-century Westerns and hope to instigate discussion about how culture makers use popular history to entertain, inform, or exploit. To what degree do films like The Revenant (2015) or the potboilers of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino reflect 21st-century sensitivities toward violence? How well do traditional or modern Westerns like No Country for Old Men (2007) reveal the complex worlds of the Mexico-U.S. border? Do remakes like The Alamo (2004), 3:10 to Yuma (2007), or The Magnificent Seven (2016) refresh or rehash older forms?

At the heart of Vierecks philosophy was the firm belief that the government should commit itself to policies that uphold restraint and modesty, and if needed, it should be used to enforce these standards throughout the nation. Over the past twenty years, scholars including Dan Carter, Elizabeth Fones-Wolf, and Daniel Stedman Jones have searched for the beginnings of modern conservatism, as well as the origins of neoliberal ideologies which it produced, only to arrive at disparate conclusions. This panel examines the political philosophies of Huey Long, Theodore Bilbo, and Claude Kirk in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of the rise of conservative politics in America. These three politicians offer a unique lens through which one can more adequately understand recent international conservative referendums such as the Brexit decision and the election of Donald Trump. Examining Long, Bilbo, and Kirk challenges the traditional timeline used in much of the recent scholarship on American conservatism and sheds important light on the connective tissue between neoliberal and conservative philosophies which have come to dominate American and international political discourse over the past 20 years.Huey Long built his political tenure on campaigns grounded in populist appeals to conservative principles of state and individual rights, which Long buttressed with calls for business-minded civic progress. Utilizing racial rhetoric only sparingly, Long set the standard for conservative discourse in the pre-war period and helped define its ideology not in terms of religiosity or racism, but in terms of business-minded civic policy. Theodore Bilbo built on Longs tradition of state and individual rights, but added a violent flare of racism to Longs concept of conservatism. During his campaign for United States Senate in 1946, Bilbo used open threats to white masculinity and white identity to win election. He became the national and international standard bearer for a new conservative ethos bolstered by voters who were willing to overlook his overtly racial politics in favor of his symbolism as a fighter for free speech and individual freedoms. In the wake of the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, overt appeals to racism were no longer palatable weapons in political battles. The man who most accurately embodied the new ideology of conservatism was Florida Governor Claude Kirk. Kirk combined veiled appeals to racism with a business model approach to government, which have become the cornerstones of neoliberal and modern conservative ideology. By fusing together and tempering the ideas of Bilbo and Long, Kirk created a conservative coalition that crossed regional lines. A careful examination of these three figures allows historians to view the direct ties between pre-war conservative thought and post-war neoliberal ideology, offering a gateway through which to view larger trends in American political and social history. </p>","A New Microscope For Modern Conservatism: Huey Long, Theodore Bilbo, And Claude Kirk At The Precipice Of Political Change "

Why havent we ever heard of her?In Adios Amor, the discovery of forgotten photographs prompts a search for an unsung heroine, Maria Moreno, a migrant mother who sacrificed everything but her twelve kids in the struggle for farm worker justice. In the late 1950s at the height of the Cold War, Maria Moreno stepped out of the shadows and spoke up for 3 million farm workers living in poverty while they harvested the food for the most affluent nation in the world. Elected by a group of Okie, Arkie, Black, Filipino and Mexican farm workers to represent their demands for equal rights and fair pay, Maria took her crusade all the way to the halls of power in Washington D.C. Although she was silenced and relegated to the sidelines of farm worker history, Maria Moreno left an inspiring legacy of multi-ethnic unity that is deeply resonant today.Today we would know nothing about Maria—not even her name—were it not for a group of maverick journalists and photographers who captured her story and kept her memory alive. Departing from a traditional cradle-to-grave biographical approach, Adios Amor unfolds as a search whose missing clues and dramatic twists raise provocative questions about whose lives we remember and record. Combining elements of the road movie with photography, long lost audio recordings, home movies, interviews and cinema vérité, Adios Amor restores aforgotten history and pays tribute to an intrepid woman whose fight for a better life has universal resonance.From the filmmaker:The seed for Adios Amor was planted a decade ago when I was lead researcher and associate producer for the Sundance Film Festival premiered documentary, The Fight in the Fields: Cesar Chavez and the Farmworkers Struggle. Looking for photographs of Cesar Chavez, I discovered a stash of hundreds of photographs of an unknown woman activist gesturing passionately, speaking her mind. Who was Maria Moreno, this woman in the world? Migrant farm workers leftfew accounts of their lives and struggles, especially in the late 50s at the close of the McCarthy era. I had uncovered buried treasure, a vivid imprint, a historical record pressed between subterranean layers of poverty, silence, loss. After working on several documentaries about illustrious men, I returned to the elusive photographs to search for Maria Moreno, and that questis the story of Adios Amor.After screening Adios Amor, filmmaker Laurie Coyle and historian advisors Vicki Ruiz and Devra Weber will engage viewers in a conversation about how the film challenges conventional histories of the farm worker movement</p>","Adios Amor—The Search For Maria Moreno"

As American state and non-state actors criss-crossed the globe and traversed national and imperial borders across the long twentieth century they brought with them their own conceptualizations of the United States and returned with new understandings of the world. While the borders themselves were very real requiring visas, passports, and other apparatuses of the nation-state, they were simultaneously conceptually fluid. Within a complex web of transnational and trans-imperial circuits Americans interpreted and constructed new understandings of the United States place in the world. At times this supported an imperial imposition of American power according to the matrices and intersections of race, class, and gender. At other times American state and non-state actors contested these very same definitions and avenues of power. Americans Abroad contributes to a growing dialogue that understands and conceives of the United States in the world through ordinary decisions and everyday material practices: from bridge construction in the Nile Valley to bicycle circumnavigations to late-twentieth century Peace Corps workers. Americans abroad translated and merged the foreign and domestic creating new avenues to understand their nations place in an increasingly connected world.Each of the papers in this session explores a different set of American state or non-state actors to think of the ways the foreign and domestic were constitutive of each other across the twentieth century. Nathan Cardons paper, In Dwarf Land and Cannibal Country: Race, Empire, and Bicycle Circumnavigations, explores the ways imperial ideas travelled with the bicycle and carried interpretative weight as white adventurers encountered colonized peoples at home and abroad. Sarah Miller-Davenports paper, Seeing Culture Everywhere: Peace Corps Service and the Challenge of Diversity at Home, uncovers the foreign policy roots of liberal multiculturalism in the U.S. by exploring the impact of returned Peace Corps volunteers on American schools and workplaces in the late 20th century. Lastly, Stephen Tufnells paper, Engineering the Scramble for Africa: American Engineers and Histories of the United States in the World, focuses on bridge-building projects in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and in the British East Africa Protectorate to propose a framework of global connectivity defined by inter-imperial interaction as one solution to navigating the tensions between imperial and global history.</p>","Americans Abroad: Reconsidering The Foreign And Domestic Across The Long 20th Century"

Evident in the conjoining of political and civic activism, historians have a clear responsibility to both present and past. Public historians are uniquely positioned to effect change in todays social confusion. Through public programming, exhibitions, and the collecting and making available the works and words of often marginalized people; we can foster environments of greater understanding-- and societal change. The four panelists have worked in museums, archives, and historic sites demonstrate the versatility of public historians and our ability to reach both within and outside of traditional education models. A multiracial dialogue has resulted from the community processing documents from Black Woman activist, Maggie L. Walker. By offering a physical space for students and visitors to learn of past civic engagements and to process and express frustrations with current injustices, the Schlesinger Library and the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel have prompted activists and traditional teachers to take action. Curators at the Ellis Island Immigration Museum inform the public and educational systems how we have come to define ourselves as we do, and who is important (or not) in the American narrative. This cross-generational, cross-racial panel discusses ways history professionals should construct history with others.</p>","Arming Citizens: Public Historians And Civic Engagement"

Interdisciplinary consideration of the artistic work of Elizabeth Catlett and Mike Gold, along  with movements such as the International Workers Order and the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born maps arcs of radical persistence and revision.

The panel examines various discourses in the mid twentieth century —medico-psychological, political, economic, and emotional—that constructed the historical experiences of Mexican Americans to sometimes stretch the terms of national inclusion and other times to position newcomers as outsiders or contingent members of the U.S. polity. In recognition of conference priorities, panelists seek to expand understanding of forms of history, as they explore ways discourses in ethnic communities, the medical and social sciences, and political and activist organizations functioned to construct a past, sometimes a past that never was, sometimes a past that pointed to an emancipatory future.Deborah Cohens paper, Migrant Psychosis, examines one medico-psychological diagnosis, migrant psychosis, applied to newcomers of color, largely temporary agricultural laborers. This formal diagnosis arising in the mid-decades of the 20th century made homesickness a disease in ways that contributed to a continued racialization of migrant labor. Ruben Flores complements Cohens paper by looking at the psychological discomfort that migrants felt as they moved from Mexico to the U.S. and were positioned as outsiders to the U.S. political project, even though they labored in sectors well integrated into the U.S. economy. Migrants experiences speak not just of feelings of discrimination and exclusion, but also to the medicalization of those feelings. Laura Westhoff explores the work of Fred Ross and the Community Service Organization (CSO) to build Mexican American activism and expand the boundaries of the inclusion in the political project of pluralist liberal democracy. Her paper illustrates the ways that common themes in U.S. historical narratives--military sacrifice, producerism, anti-communist patriotism—signaled CSO investment in particular discursive strategies that bolstered the existing liberal political project of the mid-twentieth century, while limiting its leaders from imagining and forging alliances that challenged state structures. Together, the panelists works considers how such discourses served as evidence for further discrimination, as a mode of capitulation to overarching political ideology, or as a model of emancipatory historical practice. Examining such discourses, it thus asks how constructing new forms of history might serve as a form of activism and how activism has been and continues to be a form of historical practice. Exploring discourses about those whose claims to membership in the body politic were a priori questioned, each panelist raises questions about where and how history is constituted in forms and spaces outside of its traditional academic definitions and boundaries. Today, as in the past, history in various configurations serves to foster belonging or contingency. Independent scholar and journalist Miriam Pawel will draw out these concerns, suggest the contemporary possibilities that historys various forms offer current activists and their organizing strategies, and frame conversation with the audience.</p>","Belonging And Structures Of Contingency:  What Scholarship Offers Contemporary Activists"

In the recent election campaign, Bernie Sanders denounced him; Hillary Clinton embraced him. In surveys political scientists rate him as the most effective Secretary of State in the 20th century, but when he attends public events he is met with protesters who vilify him as a war criminal. In two prominent recent books about him, Niall Ferguson and Greg Grandin offer radically different views: Ferguson portrays Kissinger as an &quot;idealist&quot; (at least before he took office) and a brilliant thinker; Grandin sees him as a uniquely pernicious influence on U.S. foreign policy. There seems to be no limit to the market for studies of Kissinger, but the vast historiography often seems trapped in a stale debate about whether Kissinger should be judged a great statesman or an evil mastermind.This panel moves beyond the predominant moralistic approach to assessing Kissinger&quot;s diplomacy. Drawing on newly declassified documents and on new approaches to international history, the panelists offer new frameworks for studying Kissinger and suggest ways to move the debate to new terrain. Micki Kaufman will describe Kissinger as revealed through the use of computational methods such as text, data, and network analysis, in a distant reading of the National Security Archives Kissinger Collection. Combining data findings with the aesthetics of data visualization, Kaufman will detail a new, digital interpretation of Kissingers complex relationships and policies, as well as insight into his behavior and personality, as revealed in the provenance and content of his correspondence. Daniel Sargent will discuss Kissingers efforts to engage with novel challenges that the advance of globalization spawned. In the mid-1970s, he will explain, Kissinger worked to reorient foreign policy towards the challenges of an emerging post-Cold War world, even as he struggled to preserve the achievements of superpower détente. Barbara Keys will take a longer view of Kissingers career, discussing, among other issues: why no one has done a full account of Kissingers career out of office, the challenges of getting information about the activities of Kissingers consulting firm, and the conflicts of interest between his post-tenure careers as a media expert on foreign relations and as a consultant for foreign governments. She will examine several episodes from his decades as an advocate for the Peoples Republic of China to suggest how emotional analysis can inform our understanding of Kissingers policy advocacy.

"<h5><i>Professor Miroslava Chávez-García (UC, Santa Barbara)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2018-04-13</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 10:00 to 11:30</h5></p><p><h5><b>Location:</b> <a href='http://www.oah.org/meetings-events/2018/sessions/' style='color:#6CADC7'>OAH Schedule</a></h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Roundtable Discussion</h5></p><p>This roundtable brings together five scholars who are committed to presenting cutting edge research within their respective fields to non-academics. As experts in disability history, indigenous history, and Chicana/o history, they hope to deepen and broaden the publics understanding of the American past by offering sweeping interpretative histories that challenge more familiar narratives. In pursuit of this goal, they individually have contributed to museum exhibitions, offered public lectures, and written surveys aimed at the widest possible audience.Most history departments and historians value research-rich monographs that focus on specialized and often narrow topics. So do the panelists. Yet rarely do monographs reach an audience that extends beyond professional peers and students as well as family members. The roundtable thus starts with the proposition that, by remaining largely outside the public domain, historians miss an opportunity at making a significant impact on the ways in which is history is recorded, interpreted, and disseminated as well as how it is consumed, understood, and weighed. We recoup the term interpretative history to describe our collective efforts of culling, sorting, and reinterpreting a broad sweep of history. Others might use the word synthetic or characterize (or disparage) any interpretative history as a textbook. Whatever the term, the challenge for us is how to weave what have been mostly marginalized histories within an overarching national history.The roundtable will address such questions as: How do we, as historians, engage a broader public? And what sectors of that public comprise our most likely audience? Given that we seek to appeal to non-experts, how do we strike a balance between the mainstream and the margin? For example, in their forthcoming book, A Chicana & Chicano History of the United States (Beacon Press), Miroslava Chávez García and Lorena Oropeza argue that Chicana/o history is American history. At the same time, the authors do not wish to convey the impression to a general audience that Chicana/o history matters only because it adds a layer of complexity to already familiar topics from settler colonialism to immigration. For her award-winning book in the same series, An Indigenous Peoples History of the United States, Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz chose to abandon standard periodization so that she could decolonize the past.Roundtable participants will examine the challenges, rewards, pitfalls and opportunities of doing interpretative history by discussing their projects and experiences. Along with Chávez-García, Oropeza, and Dunbar-Ortiz, the roundtable includes Catherine Kudlick and Kim E. Neilsen. Kudlick, a scholar of France and director of Paul K. Longmore Institute on Disability at San Francisco State University, played a critical role in curating the exhibit, Patient No More! The exhibit focuses upon an occupation of a federal building in San Francisco by disabled folks in 1977 and places it within the context of that eras social protest. Neilsen is author of A Disability History of the United States, which in one short volume examines disability history from pre-contact to the present. In 2010, the OAH recognized Neilsens talents as a communicator by appointing her a Distinguished Lecturer. </p>","Beyond The Monograph, Beyond The Margins: The Challenge Of Interpretative And Inclusive Histories"

What unmakes it? How have activists, organizers, and everyday men and women forged community and imagined commonalities, often in unlikely circumstances? Papers in this session will explore answers to these questions, building on recent historiographical discussions of late twentieth-century activism and politics in the United States. Taking cues from scholarship that has explored black-brown civil rights and seen identity politics and coalitions as mutually reinforcing, such as the 2011 edited collection, The Struggle in Black and Brown, panelists will discuss the careful, pragmatic, and divisive processes of alliance-making. Highlighting alliances made in urban and rural California, panelists will examine common goals, strategies, and ideologies – and the limits of these commonalities. From Third World alliances in the Bay Area, as Aaron Bae discusses, to the common ground of health care, explored in Rebecca Bairds study of the LA Free Clinic, radical ideology and pragmatic goals have paved the way for cross-racial and cross-class coalitions. At the same time, rhetoric and strategy have hindered alliances, dividing farmworker communities in the Coachella Valley, as Christian Paiz argues, and enabling corporate victory over a gay-labor-Latinx alliance of boycotters, the focus of Allyson Brantleys paper. This panel will offer multiple perspectives on alliance-making, opening up a wider conversation on the possibilities and pitfalls of grassroots activism in the past and present. Panelists will also consider the ways in which these histories can be made legible to activists, organizers, and leaders today, whether as inspiration or warning. </p>","Bridging Race, Ideology, And Strategy: Coalitions From The Long 1960s To The Reagan Years"

Juana Briones y su California – Pionera, Fundadora, Curandera (Juana Briones and her California – Pioneer, Founder, and Folk Healer) brought to the California public the story of the life and times of Juana Briones (1802–1889), a pivotal historical figure whose life was part of the transformation of California under three flags: Spain, Mexico, and the United States. The exhibition was an offshoot of an initiative by Palo Alto area local citizens over several years to help save the historic Briones farm home from destruction to make way for a multi-million house in the Palo Alto foothills. Over time, this initiative morphed into an extensive historical recovery project, a senior honors thesis written by a student in the Public History major at Stanford University, and, finally, a major public exhibition developed by the California Historical Society in partnership with Stanford University. The panel will recount the process of conceptualizing and mounting the Juana Briones exhibition. Albert Camarillo will chair the panel and provide the historical contexts regarding the efforts to save the Briones home; he will describe the early stages of a public history initiative and working in collaboration as guest curator with the CHS staff to develop the exhibition. Maritza Urquiza (BA 2013) will discuss how in her senior honors thesis in the Public History major in the Department of History at Stanford she developed the public history presentation framework for the exhibition that was opened by the CHS in January 2014. Dr. Anthea Hartig will provide the view of the CHS and how an extensive primary research recovery process allowed the CHS to exhibit a rich array of documents, artifacts, and a wall rescued from the Briones home before its demolition. Thousands of Californians viewed the exhibition on site in 2014, later through a traveling exhibition in Sacramento, and by accessing the CHSs website about the exhibition.Using a multi-media presentation, the panelists will show slides from the exhibition of paintings, maps, portraits, legal documents, and artifacts in telling how Juana Briones was a woman adaptable to changing times yet undaunted in her pursuits to carve out a life for herself, her children, and community of which she was a part in nineteenth century California. </p>","Bringing Latina History To The Public: The Juana Briones Exhibition And The California Historical Society"

Yet outside of well-worn flashpoints the connections between individuals and institutions is often obscured in studies of the broader development of American sports. This panel will borrow from recent historiographical developments that place institutional and personal perspectives alongside one another in examining the development of American culture.  The relationship between these perspectives is particularly important in athletics, as Americans experienced sports not just in owners shiny new stadiums or in the sports-centered newspaper sections, but also as individuals participating in sports on their own terms.  Sports in the early twentieth century had powerful backers who understood the potential of athletics and debated whether they should promote amateurism and idealism of American masculinity or embrace a professionalized industry profiting from a nation bent on mass consumer culture. Individual participants and spectators intervened in these debates both in print and with their consumption choices, using their love of sports to shape American sports culture. Giving institutions such as the Presidency and the Army a prominent role, this panel underscores the reality that sports has always been deeply connected to powerful interests.  Bringing the individual athlete and spectator closer to the center of analysis, this panel also hopes to highlight experiences across racial, class, and gender barriers, important perspectives that demonstrate a mass public is made up of many unique Americans who engage with sports because of their own interests.  This panel will present material from scholars examining sources on the institutional and personal levels to illustrate how both shaped the development of collegiate and professional sports.  By examining and discussing these perspectives jointly, historians can demonstrate the complex give and take between institutional structure and personal agency that built American society over the past century. </p>","Building And Rebuilding Sports:  Institutions, Individuals, And American Athletics In The Early 20th Century"

Nonreligious historians have tended to overlook lived religion, and Catholic historians have adopted a parochial habit of writing largely for one another. This panel seeks to highlight and remedy these historiographical blind spots through case studies that intertwine Catholic history with modern American social and political histories during the urban crisis. Scholars cannot fully understand the lived history of this period of significant transformation without reference to Catholics, who stood at the vanguard of efforts to resist desegregation. Additionally, historians also cannot fully explain the impact of the economic and social restructuring of the city without considering how these forces reshaped institutions, and especially – as the largest private institution in Northern cities – the Catholic Church. In illustrating the dual role of Catholicism as (1) a religious practice that interacted with American political culture and (2) an urban institution that mediated social movements, we will explore the ways Catholicism governed and defined the contours of the urban crisis, a period in which Catholicism and the Church were indelibly altered and fractured by the politics of race. The Black Freedom Movement, combined with the liberalizing reforms of the Second Vatican Council, pushed the Church and its parishioners in conflicting directions. As black Catholics and liberal priests used their parishes as spaces to engage in black community building and the politics of Black Power, white working-class Catholics shifted toward the nascent conservative movement. Yet all ostensibly adhered to the same doctrinal beliefs. How can we explain this divergence, and how can it refine our understanding of the politics of the urban crisis?Each presenter in this panel takes up the question of how the religiosity of Catholic parishioners interacted with their lived experiences during the turbulent period of the 1960s and early 1970s, and how, in turn, these factors shaped their political identities and the character of their church. Matthew Cresslers paper examines the urban crisis through the lens of Catholic schools, demonstrating that investment in parochial schools shifted from city to suburb and, in effect, eliminated educational opportunities for black children. Matthew Pehl provides a portrait of working-class white Catholics in a labor history of urban police departments. His paper shows that racially charged fears about rising crime rates in American cities created rifts between traditional parishioners and liberal priests, and explores how Catholic police chaplains attempted to bridge the gap. Cassie Millers paper demonstrates that the Churchs increasing rhetorical and material support of anti-poverty initiatives in black and Puerto Rican neighborhoods frustrated white urban parishioners, and contributed to a more general sense of dispossession that led working-class whites to embrace conservatism. Through this panel, we hope to raise questions about the relationship between religion, race, and politics, and, more broadly, to demonstrate that religious identity and religious institutions are subjects valuable to historical inquiry.  </p>","Catholics And The Urban Crisis: Religion, Politics, And Race In Northern Cities "

General Ulysses S. Grant commands the focus of the painting, surrounded by twenty-six subordinates, including Generals George Gordon Meade and Joseph Hooker.  In the years following Appomattox, however, the commanders and soldiers responsible for Union victory slowly moved into the shadows of American culture, as the Lost Cause narrative began to take hold.  This narrative, which championed southern soldiers and generals, came to dominate American culture and memory.  This panel seeks to shift the historical conversation from the Lost Cause troupe and highlight the place of Union generals in the postwar dialogue.  The Organization of American Historians conference theme, The Forms of History, offers a fitting opportunity to examine three Union generals, Ulysses S. Grant, Joseph Hooker, and George Meade, and their role in facilitating the conversation on the Civil War.Brooks Simpson explores the ways in which Grant actively shaped the postwar narrative through his personal and private writings.  Simpson argues that Grants contribution to the postwar dialogue came from more than his acclaimed Personal Memoirs.  Instead, Simpson reveals a Grant who was actively engaged in postwar correspondence, shaping the ways in which Americans remembered the Union victory, and staunchly defended his wartime record.  For many Americans, and certainly for Hanson, Grant stood at the center of Union success, while other generals toiled in his shadows.  Although George Gordon Meade commanded the Army of the Potomac longer than any other general, Meade never reached the enduring fame of his contemporaries, namely Grant and William T. Sherman.  Jennifer Murray explores the legacy of George Meade and his place in the Civil War canon.  While Meade has nearly faded into obscurity in todays Civil War dialogue, Murray contends that among his contemporary and early 20th century Americans, Meade achieved a prominent place in the historical narrative.  She explores Meades place in American memory through two forms of history, the written narrative and the commemorative landscape.  In doing so, Murray reveals a commemorative tradition that sought to place Meade as an integral figure in Union victory and American history.  The final paper explores the Civil War career and postwar narrative of a similarly lesser-known Union general.  General Hookers place in the historical narrative often centers on the failed campaign at Chancellorsville (May 1863) and his volatile relations with President Abraham Lincoln, his commander-in-chief.  Ethan Rafuse offers an assessment of wartime civil-military relations in his exploration of the dynamic between Lincoln and Hooker.  Rafuse examines the ways in which this relationship has been portrayed in history, focusing on how particular characteristics of each of these men have been amplified in the historical dialogue and by subsequent generations of historians.  Collectively these three papers offer a lens to reevaluate three of the Civil Wars most influential commanders and underscore the means in which their historical legacies have been a malleable form of history.</p>","Civil War Union Generals In War & Memory"

The statement, while humorous, reflected the reality that service members faced considerable difficulty in combining family life with military service.  Military officials assigned personnel without much regard for family needs, often forcing families to struggle through long deployments, to move to new assignments on short notice, and to adapt to new schools and communities on a regular basis.  These circumstances placed much of the burden on wives and children who were expected to bear the burdens of service cheerfully so as not to impede their husbands and fathers career.  Service women faced even higher hurdles.  Until the Vietnam War era, policies forbid women from having children and discriminated against their husbands.  By the turn of the twenty-first century, however, military family policies had undergone a sea change.  Military families were no longer uncommon and, indeed, wielded great influence over military culture and policies.  In 2014, 55 percent of active duty personnel were married, while 42 percent of active and reserve personnel were parents.  This panel examines how and why this transition occurred and argues that military families have played significant—if under-examined—roles in shaping military culture and foreign policy.  The panel will begin with Michael Timonins research on military wives efforts to speed the demobilization process at the close of World War II.  As his paper will suggest, military wives employed a language of domesticity and maternal care as they lobbied Congress and military officials to return their husbands so they could assume their roles as breadwinners and providers.  This gendered language, while conventional in many respects, offered women a new role in shaping military and foreign policy.  However troublesome military officials might have considered the wives examined in Timonins work, within a few years they began to rely on military wives to project a positive image of American culture during the tumultuous Cold War.  Amanda Boczar will describe the development of a family-friendly culture within the army, while paying close attention to the ways policies varied by race, class, rank, and location.  The development of a family-friendly military necessitated a host of policy and cultural changes, as Kara Dixon Vuics research on military welfare programs will demonstrate.  Morale and recreation programs ballooned in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries to provide a wealth of new programming designed to ease the separation of spouses and of parents and children, especially during wartime deployments.  Together, the papers draw connections between military, social, womens, gender, and diplomatic history.  Maria Hӧhn, whose seminal work on American military personnel in Germany provided a model for historians study of the social, cultural, and diplomatic functions of military families, will chair and comment.  The panelists are committed to facilitating greater audience participation and questions than is normally afforded and will therefore limit their remarks to ten minutes.  After brief commentary, the panel will open to audience discussion.  </p>","Cod Liver Oil, Model Families, And Sesame Street: Creating Military Families In The Twentieth Century"

Between 1820 and 1860, growing numbers of women moved across regions and through cities, joined religious sects and reform movements, and treated prostitution as equivalent to other forms of waged labor. Their actions threatened to weaken bedrock American institutions, such as marriage and slavery, which controlled their sexual and reproductive lives while also extracting their labor. Capitalization, urban migration, and religious ferment offered chances to pursue limited forms of independence from these institutions—and hundreds of thousands of women risked very real dangers of violence in taking those chances. Yet, as these three papers will argue, the discourses of captivity that emerged in this period obscured much of the systemic violence women already faced and some even produced new opportunities for exploitation. All three papers show that framing sex (especially for the youthful) as coercion or captivity served to obfuscate the ways that some young women were making sexual choices on their own, albeit constrained, terms. In antebellum America imagining sex as captivity also carried powerful connotations of slavery, slowing gaining traction as the institution against which Northerners sought to define their way of life. Kara Frenchs paper focuses on anti-Shaker and Catholic tracts that depicted celibate women as coerced into their roles, rather than having made choices to eschew sex for religious devotion. French highlights the ways that these narratives of captivity and coercion served as a distraction from the challenge to traditional femininity posed by celibacy. April Haynes, by contrast, looks at efforts to redirect racially diverse working-class girls away from prostitution and toward the ostensibly free labor of domestic service. By representing sex work as a form of slavery, reformers built a coercive regime of waged household labor with long-term consequences for the racialized and gendered sector of care work. Finally, Nicholas Syrett examines accusations of kidnapping and infanticide lodged at Madame Restell, New Yorks notorious abortionist, arguing that focusing on the exploitation and harm of live children served as a proxy for new understandings of abortion as child murder that emerged with the rise of a protected, middle class childhood. They were also a way for anxious citizens to condemn abortionists who eradicated the consequences of young womens sinful pasts, thus intervening between daughters and their rightful protectors and masters: their parents. All three scholars write history in its traditional form, but all are also reading against the grain of sources that envision women and girls as always already sexually exploited. We are fortunate to have historians Janet Farrell Brodie and Sharon Block as chair and commentator, respectively, two historians whose work on sexuality in early America has been foundational to these conversations about coercion, commodification, and captivity. </p>","Coercion, Kidnapping, And Commodification: Discourses Of Sexuality And Exploitation In The Antebellum North"

Each of these papers discusses the many ways in which problems within families and communities complicated the power relationships between those families and communities and the larger state. In many Midwestern communities, poor farms were the last line of defense of indigent women whose families could not, or would not, help them in times of trouble.  These institutions were the way in which communities provided a minimal standard of living and a safety net for women without alternatives.  This panel will also examine the issue of ethnicity, and the way in which Mexican Americans worked to create their own communities in the midst of the regions dominant European ethnic population.  Crisis is at the center of the third paper, and the ways in which the state, this time Iowa, did not adequately deal with the problems of indigent families during the Great Depression.  The final paper will tackle the problem of child saving, and the way in which child saving for Native American children was both similar and different for that for European American children.

Eschewing East-coast, Anglo-Protestant perspectives, these papers present alternatives to the enduring narrative of Manifest Destiny, and examine the consequences wrought by these competing desires for the West, often from the point of view of those actually living there. Together, we hope to present a place and time marked by contingency, where overlooked institutions and economies, or the actions of an inspired few, could have profound effects on the course of 19th century American history. Max Forrester looks at religion and diplomacy in the experience of immigrant and sedentary Indian groups in the Texas borderlands in the two decades before the U.S.-Mexican War, and argues that issues of faith and perceptions of fate profoundly influenced the political choices of Native peoples trapped between allegiances. The alliances that these Indian groups founded were frequently comprised of incredibly diverse peoples (Western Cherokees, Kickapoos, Delawares, Shawnees, among others); this paper explores the role that mutually intelligible understandings of fate could play in facilitating a language of diplomacy, overcoming cultural differences and resource shortages, and choosing sides when violent conflict became inevitable. Sean Harvey examines Albert Gallatins attempts to organize widespread opposition to the U.S.-Mexican War by tracing the networks of individuals extending far beyond the East coast that informed and facilitated his efforts. Gallatin opposed expansionism, doubting that the union could encompass territories stretching to the Pacific. Yet, what he considered an unjust war also promised a windfall of ethnological knowledge concerning the possibility of indigenous social development. This paper argues that Gallatin&quot;s efforts reveal the complementary roles of learned societies and religious organizations in allowing prominent men to parlay wealth, reputation, and local weight into national influence in a representative democracy through the public sphere. James Nichols examines the arrival of Black Creeks, Seminoles, and Kickapoos to the South Texas borderlands following the U.S.-Mexican War. Invited across the border by Mexico in an attempt to populate and protect the region, these so-called tribus emigradas instead imagined an independent pan-Indian colony outside of the purview of both Mexico and the United States. Through an analysis of cultural identities and visionary politics, this paper demonstrates that even after the making of the modern boundary in 1848, the geographical destiny of the south Texas borderlands was anything but certain.Nakia Parker looks at forced migration patterns and lived experiences of people of African and black Indian descent who came with their Native enslavers from the southeastern United States to resettle in the West. Considering Indian and black forced migrations in tandem, instead of as separate and pivotal traumatic events, can illuminate topics such as Native American involvement in the market economy and how conceptions of blackness and notions of Native sovereignty and futurity formed, collided, and reconciled during the mid-19th century. Ultimately, this paper aims to demonstrate that Native Americans were principal, not peripheral, historical actors in the institution of slavery in the Southwest as well as the domestic slave trade. </p>","Consider The Alternative: The Uncertain Fate Of The Antebellum West"

We contend that the conditions of the present make historical inquiry into this earlier moment of immigrant removal as urgent as ever.  Our panel excavates the historical contours, contingencies, and impacts of repatriation between the 1920s and 1940s, focusing especially on the repatriation of ethnic Mexicans and also, to a lesser extent, that of Filipino populations.  In sites ranging from formal policy and law to courtrooms, aid agencies, labor and social movements, and the families and communities of repatriates themselves, we consider how struggles to define, implement, and respond to repatriation contributed to broader constructions of citizenship and belonging.  Our panel examines the interface between consent and coercion in the implementation of repatriation policies and sheds light on the ways targeted populations maneuvered within prevailing political constraints.  This examination offers new insights into the ways the boundaries of citizenship were constructed, enforced, and challenged in an era of deep economic and political crisis.  Significantly, it also produces lessons about the pursuit of belonging, rights, and justice, lessons that have particular relevance as we confront forces of racial and national exclusion similar to those of the Great Depression era at present.  The papers in this panel highlight varying aspects of repatriation across the longer arc of the Depression and World War II eras. Marla Ramírezs paper examines five identifiable waves of repatriation between 1831 and 1944, sorting through important ambiguities in the sources and slippages in historical narratives, offering important new insights concerning divergences and continuities in ethnic Mexicans experiences of repatriation as a cross-generational phenomenon.  Elizabeth Sines paper explores grassroots responses to repatriation during the 1930s, highlighting the variety of social and cultural practices targeted populations engaged in their efforts to endure the removal campaigns and to construct notions of belonging for themselves.  Romeo Guzmán brings into focus repatriated ethnic Mexicans efforts to return to the United States, shedding new light on the ways they drew on transnational kinship networks, made claims on the state, and reenvisioned citizenship in the process.  Yuki Oda takes up the efforts of returning Mexican American repatriates and their families to evince their U.S. citizenship, revealing the troubles that surrounded efforts to prove their national membership during and after the World War II period.  Together, the papers not only illuminate the protracted and contested nature of repatriations history; they provide a generative point of departure for building a collaborative discussion about the form and function of historical inquiry in our present moment of political crisis and anti-immigrant hysteria.  It raises critical questions about the interplay between the national and the transnational in the lives of marginalized and migrant populations, and about the meanings and nature of rights, citizenship, and social membership.</p>","Constructions Of Citizenship And Belonging In The Repatriation Era"

This project analyzes the construction of territory in a borderlands region where struggle took many forms, particularly for the diverse peoples who lived in and near Dien Bien Phu—an out of the way place but also a pivot point in world history. There, in one of the 20th centurys most important battles, Vietnam defeated France to win the First Indochina War (1946-54) and earn independence. The battle was a fulcrum in a global transformation from European empire to national self-determination, inspiring anti-colonial activists from Jakarta to Algiers. It also shattered Dien Biens local economy, leaving a landscape scarred by trenches and bereft of livestock, cupboards bare of rice and seed. Tracing Vietnams postcolonial transition through a historical and political geography of 1950s Dien Bien Phu, this region poses questions for scholars of agrarian societies, political geography, and Southeast Asia. What did it mean to become a postcolonial subject? How is territory shaped, and shaped by, resource access? Why were peasants, long seen as engines of Vietnams revolution, so upset with its outcome?This same region asks educators in middle, secondary, and post-secondary classrooms to also grapple with the question: Why did the US Government reverse its support for an independent Vietnam? This question is central to understanding Americas complex role in Southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s.  Specifically, this question takes us back to 1945 and directly to Ba Dinh Square in Hanoi, when the Roosevelt administration backed the Viet Minh and the DRVs declaration of independence, and to 1951 (or so) when the Truman administration threw its weight behind France in Asias emerging Cold War. Moreover, and rather than over-focus on the American angle, the question invites us to investigate Vietnamese history during the First Indochina War (1946-54). Understanding this period of post-WWII decolonization helps explain why partition in 1954 violated the nationalist principle of unity (one Vietnam) but led, unintentionally but inexorably, to a Cold War crisis.This panel represents a research team that investigated the complex and contested territory of the Black River Region from Hanoi to Dien Bien Phu in an effort to better understand the pretext for Americas involvement in Vietnam.  This work relied on visualization technologies to support scholarship with interdisciplinary humanities.  These technologies included geospatial mapping tools and location-based augmented reality mobile app. Our deliverable is a classroom-ready set of resources that will enable students in middle and secondary grades and in college and university courses to better understand Vietnams diverse society. </p>","Contested Territory: Dien Bien Phu And The Making Of Northwest Vietnam"

Wikipedia and the Future of the Past. By then Wikipedia had already become, he said, perhaps the largest work of online historical writing, the most widely read work of digital history, and the most important free historical resource on the World Wide Web. But Wikipedias anarchic editing process and uneven reliability have long repelled academics. Despite studies—including Rosenzweigs—comparing it favorably to traditional encyclopedias, its still the sour taste of Wikipedia that spoils much discussion of open source history, particularly outside of the digital humanities. But Rosenzweig believed that if historians believe that what is available free on the Web is low quality, then we have a responsibility to make better information sources available online. Historians could endlessly indict Wikipedia for its many shortcomings, or, he said, we could emulate [its] great democratic triumph … its demonstration that people are eager for free and accessible information resources.In 2014, after a year-long collaboration, over 350 historians produced a first edition of The American Yawp (www.americanyawp.com), a free and online, collaboratively built, open-source American history textbook designed for college-level history courses. Launched as a radical experiment in mass collaboration and institution-free pedagogy—a growing and widely successful experiment that 150,000 users already benefit from each semester—the Yawp was only a logical extension of the democratic promise inherent not just in the rise of the Digital Humanities as an identifiable academic field, but in a moment when technological innovation, institutional resources, professional norms, and shifting scholarly attitudes have converged to prove Rosenzweig right: history can be open source. The editors of The American Yawp are joined by contributor and chapter editor Angela Esco Elder and Stanford University Press acquisitions editor Margo Irvin (SUP is partnering with the Yawp to explore new paths for the publication of open texts) to discuss the promise and perils of mass collaboration in democratizing the American history survey. How can scholars collaborate across institutions to build resources for the classroom? How is open-source licensing changing historical pedagogy? And in a connected, digital age, what is the future of the American history textbook? How, for instance, are publishers reacting to new technology? Digital humanities scholar Kathryn Tomasek will therefore guide a discussion that addresses these questions while exploring the nature of the American history survey, the collaborative potential of the digital humanities, and the role of university presses in balancing a democratized history with the maintenance of the highest standards of the discipline. </p>","Democratizing The American History Textbook: Mass Collaboration And The American Yawp"

Often, they achieved surprising success, despite enormous obstacles, from rapidly shifting economies to deeply recalcitrant white political structures. These certainly were the circumstances facing African Americans who began winning mayoral elections in the 1960s and 70s, such as Carl Stokes in Cleveland, Tom Bradley in Los Angeles, and Maynard Jackson in Atlanta. Though typically considered the break-through generation of black mayors, these men had important predecessors in cities across the South. One hundred years before the civil rights generation, African American mayors, such as Robert H. Wood in Natchez, Mississippi, and Stephen Swails in Kingstree, South Carolina, also led local governments through tumultuous times. A comparison of first- and second-wave black mayors reveals significant shifts – and continuities – in urban politics, citizenship, and the African American struggle for political representation.By putting into conversation civil rights and Reconstruction scholars who rarely interact despite common areas of interest, this panel assesses the long black mayoral experience. How did African American mayors navigate the tricky politics of race and class in two distinct eras – Reconstruction and the aftermath of the Civil War, and the post-1960s age of anxiety and rise of modern conservatism. What overlapping issues formed and informed their approaches to urban governance, such as debt, infrastructure, development, and services? How were these politicians able to build sustainable coalitions to win elections and to govern? How much did national politics build on or infringe upon their ability to govern at the local level? Ultimately, what were the policies, and tactics circulating among black executives in two key moments of political and racial transition?The three papers here engage these questions across often rigid sub-disciplinary boundaries. Justin Behrend addresses how Robert H. Wood and other black officials in Natchez negotiated the perilous divisions of Reconstruction southern politics in terms of race, class, and color in the 1870s. In contrast to black legislators and members of Congress during Reconstruction, their executive counterparts have received little scholarly attention. Gordon Mantler explores the great potential and limits of winning City Hall by looking at Harold Washingtons early years as Chicagos first black mayor in the mid-1980s. While often viewed as a successful movement triumph, Washington struggled to build anything beyond a fleeting coalition of mostly black and Latino voters in the face of considerable systemic challenges, locally and nationally. Matthew Countryman writes about the role of black mayors in national politics after 1967. The decision of the Johnson administration that year to support the mayoral candidacies of Richard Hatcher and Carl Stokes, in defiance of the local Democratic Party organizations, signaled a new relationship between the national party and black political leadership. Countryman&quot;s paper explores the efforts of black mayors to shape the partys policies on race in cities in the 1970s and 1980s. Spanning more than a century, these papers explore the power and limits of black mayors in urban and national politics.</p>","Different Eras, Same Challenges?

Digital forms are transforming the kinds of scholarship produced by historians and encouraging new methods of storytelling. The digital increases our need to pay attention to the role of interactivity and visuality in argumentation, challenges the privileging of single authorship, and broadens our potential audiences. Each member of the roundtable will discuss these core issues through the lens of their digital scholarship.  Moderator Lauren Tilton will discuss Photogrammar (photogrammar.yale.edu), a web-based platform that allows users to organize, search, and visualize over 170,000 photographs from 1935 to 1944. She will briefly demonstrate how historical archives can be digitally reimagined to increase scholarship, visibility, and usability. Key issues she will discuss include what constitutes a digital scholarly argument, forms of knowledge production, the opportunities and challenges of collaboration, and structures of labor. Grace Hale will discuss Participatory Media (participatorymediaproject.org), an online project with funding from the NEHs Public Programs Division that interactively engages with and presents participatory community media from the 1960s and 1970s.   PM centralizes disparate archives of community media and places them in the larger context of Americas public documentary record. Along with issues about the forms of knowledge, her comments will speak to issues of collaboration with community partners and audience.Mapping Inequality (dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining), led by Rob Nelson, updates the study of New Deal America, the federal government, housing, and inequality for the twenty-first century. His comments will focus on interactive maps as a medium of public history. Viewed by more than 80,000 since October, it has been the subject of media commentary across the political spectrum from Dissent on the left to American Renaissance on the right. His comments will assess the effectiveness and limitations of Mapping Inequality and mapping more generally for prompting a broad public appreciation of and reckoning with the history of racial inequality in U.S. history.Monica Martinezs Mapping Violence makes visible the history of violence against Mexican-Americans by mapping border violence in Texas. Historians have outlined protocols and limits for retelling histories of slavery, genocide, colonialism, and rape. Fundamental questions remain about the limits and possibilities created when history and the digital humanities converge. What are the best methods for giving faces and names to the dead and to those that lived in the wake of violence? Martinez will discuss the protocols and limits for visually representing histories of racial violence for the public. While each project addresses a major moment in twentieth century US history, their approach to digital knowledge formation, collaboration, evidence, and audience varies based on their object of study, institutional resources, and stakeholders. The contours of these challenges and opportunities will be central to this roundtable. We will begin with a five minute introduction of each project. The moderator will pose several questions that discuss issues of digital form, project design, authorship and collaboration, and audience. We will then open up the conversation to the audience.</p>","Digital History: Possibilities And Challenges "

Although originally conceived as an artistic, expressive, and accessible technological medium for ordinary people, digital storytelling techniques have been used in the classroom to integrate disciplinary content and students prior knowledge and skills.  Completed projects can be shared in classroom film festivals or shared online, in a variety of formats and organizational schemes.This interactive workshop will introduce participants to the ways in which digital storytelling can be utilized in the undergraduate classroom to deeply engage students in historical thinking and to immerse them in the process of constructing historical knowledge, using archival materials (images, documents, texts, and sounds), critical thinking, and narrative voice.   The facilitators, seasoned practitioners of digital storytelling in the classroom, will explain the seven key elements of effective digital storytelling (point of view, dramatic question, emotional content, voiceover, soundtrack, economy, and pacing), and will provide specific examples of how digital storytelling can be effectively incorporated into the undergraduate history classroom as an integrative or creative project. Examples will be drawn from the facilitators recent and ongoing courses in African American History, the Social History of the American Family, Womens History, and American Studies.  Digital storytelling capstone projects typically include the following parts:  the script, the edited film, and a contextual essay in which students discuss primary and secondary sources and reflect on the process of making history.   In our experience, digital storytelling projects provide excellent opportunities to engage students in a variety of practical and theoretical questions central to historical analysis: What is historical truth? What is valid historical evidence? What is an objective stance? What are the genre conventions of history? What is the role of narrative voice, analogy, and metaphor in historical argument?  And so on.  Significantly, the skills gained from the digital storytelling process (writing, processing and sequencing still images and video clips, basic film editing, spoken-word narration, audio recording, and presenting on social media) are readily transferable to other classes, to workplace contexts, and, more generally, to students own lives.The workshop will conclude with a discussion of how to scaffold digital skills for novice learners, how to design and sell digital projects to students, and how to assess student learning outcomes of digital-story projects. Importantly, we will explore the ways in which small-scale digital assignments of all kinds increase student engagement, critical thinking, digital literacy, and metacognitive reflection in the undergraduate history classroom.   Participants will leave with sample assignments, rubrics, and other teaching resources.  This is intended to be a hands-on workshop and faculty are encouraged to come with questions and ideas of how they might integrate digital tools into their own classrooms and curriculums. </p>","Digital Storytelling In Teaching History"

What does it mean to create an ambitious new exhibit focused on more recent immigrant history, challenging the distinction between &quot;legal&quot; and undocumented immigration? How does our work as historians embroil us in civic controversy, and how can we best contribute to the debate? How can research on twentieth-century migrant farm workers inform engagement with the present or work with the federal government?

But down ballot Democratic candidates have been losing—badly—for the past several decades.  By 2014, Republicans had gained a larger share of seats in state legislatures than at time since the 1920s. Trumps election marks the completion of a long political realignment that began in the 1960s. This transformation has resulted in a Republican Party that, for decades following the New Deal, was a minority party in Congress and most state governments, into one that dominates those branches and levels of government and speaks to the same demographics of voters that once constituted the Democratic Partys base. In light of the recent election and the incoming Trump administration, this roundtable will examine this political realignment and the recent history of liberalism.  Few recent books lend more insight into the current state of the Democratic Party and how it got there than Lily Geismers 2015 book, Dont Blame Us: Suburban Liberals and the Transformation of the Democratic Party.  Borrowing from the books title and using its account of suburban politics and the rise of suburban liberalism as a starting point for exploring the present moment, the panel will bring together a group of historians who will offer different views on the history and future of the Democratic Party.  In tracing the demise of labor and working-class politics and the Democratic Partys embrace of neoliberalism, Dont Blame Us offers a new framework for understanding the political revolutions of the past half-century and the long-term trends that resulted in Trumps election.  Panelists will discuss topics such as: the Democratic Partys retreat from New Deal liberalism and embrace of market-driven, technocratic policy solutions to structural inequality since the 1970s; the loss of working-class white voters and struggle to build a multiracial and -ethnic coalition; the debate over &quot;identity politics and the mounting disillusionment of minority voters during the Obama presidency; Republican dominance in local elections; and the extent to which 2016 signaled a broad-based repudiation of liberalism among voters on the left and right.</p>","Don't Blame Us...

Examining this duality maintains a productive focus on the contested and constructed nature of categories that are often naturalized. Each presenter contributes a new perspective into how individuals navigated the fraught zone of interaction with dominant expectations of Asians and Asian Americans in the twentieth century. The papers also demonstrate how gender has fundamentally shaped ethnicity as an imagined and lived reality. Genevieve Clutario highlights the predatory uses of ethnic duality. In her discussion of the Muslim Filipina Princess Tarhata Kiram, Clutario examines the efforts of the U.S. colonial government to use Kiram as a manipulated cultural envoy after WWI. By bringing Kiram to the United States for her college education, the government sought to Americanize her just enough before returning her to the Philippines to serve as a kind of cultural Trojan horse. Kirams body, dress, and behavior all became objects of public scrutiny as evidence of her carefully bounded transformations – or lack thereof.  Annelise Heinzs paper focuses on spaces of ethnic construction within the context of an outsider gaze. In 1930s Chinatowns, Chinese Americans promoted the parlor game of mahjong as a commodified form of Chinese culture to white Americans, while simultaneously using the game to create a sense of cultural cohesion. The spaces marked by mahjong games facilitated distinct gendered patterns, as well as rare intergenerational socializing among Chinese Americans. Heinz examines how mahjong culture provides one example of how individuals navigated the limited possibilities of American inclusion; a younger generation connected examples of Chinese authenticity with American popular culture.In her paper profiling Patsy Mink, Judy Tzu-Chun Wu focuses on Minks political negotiations of the expectations foisted upon her as the first woman of color in the U.S. House of Representatives. In her powerful role as Representative, Minks public persona also reinforced Cold War narratives of American democracy. Wu shows how Mink navigated a pervasive focus on her appearance and both gendered and ethnic expectations in her work to challenge Cold War militarism. In addition, our panel embraces the OAHs call for more engaging forms of presentation. Our goal is to facilitate a deeper conversation by using the individual papers as a springboard to discuss unifying topics rather than specific details. To do so, the three presenters will precirculate papers to each other. At the conference, each author will briefly highlight her case study in a dynamic presentation not to exceed ten minutes. Lon Kurashige will then provide a comment that focuses on bringing together the conversation to shared concepts and topics. One such unifying thread will involve foregrounding visual representations in our research and analysis. With visuals, we can vary the form of conversation and invite more exchanges with the audience. Such a format will allow 15 minutes of conversation among the panelists as well as 35 minutes of discussion with the audience. </p>","Double-Edged Ethnicity: Asian/Americans In The Twentieth Century"

East LA Interchange was released this fall and is being used in over thirty universities for classes within American History, Chicana/o & Latina/o Studies, Asian American Studies, African American Studies, Ethnic Studies, Urban Studies and Planning, and American Studies.East LA Interchange tells the story of working-class, immigrant Boyle Heights, the oldest neighborhood in East Los Angeles.  Targeted by government policies, real estate laws, and California planners, this quintessential immigrant neighborhood survived racially restrictive housing covenants, Japanese-American Internment, Federal redlining policies, lack of political representation, and the building of the largest and busiest freeway interchange system in North America, the East L.A. Interchange.  We witness Boyle Heights remarkable legacy of political activism and multiculturalism in the face of harsh political, spacial and economic realities.Boyle Heights was once one of the most diverse, multicultural areas in the United States. Founded in 1875, Boyle Heights by the 1920s had evolved into a multiracial neighborhood more diverse than most U. S. cities at the time with Latinos, Asians, African-Americans, and the largest settlement of Jews west of Chicago living and working together side-by-side.  A 1954 article in Fortnight declared, Few districts in America are as ethnically dynamic, politically tolerant, and community-proud… East LA Interchange charts Boyle Heights evolution from multiethnic to predominantly Latino as the neighborhood became a nucleus of Mexican-American history and culture in the U.S.East LA Interchange presents a complex picture of the many issues Boyle Heights residents have faced through the years such as access to education, gang violence, discriminatory immigration policies, environmental pollution and gentrification. The question of whether an evolving Boyle Heights can preserve its unique culture and history along with a desire to create new opportunities and a healthier environment for its residents is one that many communities throughout the country are currently facing.  In East LA Interchange, NYU historian John Kuo Wei Tchen says, Places like Boyle Heights are literally on the cutting edge of what this country is becoming.Studying Boyle Heights multicultural history and understanding its present serves as an imperative lesson in cooperation and tolerance for our increasingly divided society today. East LA Interchange takes a thought-provoking approach that leaves viewers with questions about the possibilities of community in the U.S.: could a neighborhood like Boyle Heights thrive in our contemporary society where fear and prejudice against low-income and immigrant populations abound?  As our presidential elections anti-immigrant and racist rhetoric has shown, the question remains whether the U.S. will be able to learn from the example of Boyle Heights to create an environment that welcomes and celebrates multiculturalism.The film features will.i.am (The Black Eyed Peas), Father Greg Boyle (Homeboy Industries), Josefina López (Real Women Have Curves), Dr. George J.

Brock (City University of New York)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2018-04-12</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 11:00 to 00:30</h5></p><p><h5><b>Location:</b> <a href='http://www.oah.org/meetings-events/2018/sessions/' style='color:#6CADC7'>OAH Schedule</a></h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Session</h5></p><p>This four-paper panel, Economics and Politics: Civil War Era Latin American Relations with the Southern U.S., argues that southerners capitalized on their Latin American economic connections to promote southern interests.  Tracing this long-standing, outwardly focused southern gaze sheds new light on the reality of southern diplomacy, expansionism, and economic modernization both before and after the Civil War.  Despite extensive nineteenth-century economic networks between the South and Latin America, historians have generally favored discussions about southern-European relations.  Transnational and global contexts related to Latin America and the American South during the Civil War Era have received considerably less attention.The panel members seek to remedy this historiographical shortcoming.  Mariana Muazes paper highlights the flexibility of antebellum slavery in the Mississippi Valley when it compares slavery in this southern valley to systems of slavery in the Vale do Paraíba of Brazil.  She explores how masters awareness of other systems of slavery impacted the living spaces of slaves.  Southerners used their knowledge of Latin American natural resources and trading ports, as well as Latin American systems of slavery, to promote their own economic agendas.  Ximena Sevilla creates an environmental history when she argues that definitions of the relationship between humans and nature defined scientific understandings of the Peruvian Upper Amazon during the nineteenth century.  By defining this relationship as an overabundance of resources, explorers focused on finding a region with climatic conditions suitable for foreigners willing to expand the commercial networks of these resources.  Explorers emphasized the economic opportunities provided by the navigability of the Amazon River and its tributaries in order to connect these remote areas with industrial centers located in the United States.  As Darryl Brock demonstrates in his paper, members of the Trans-Mississippi Department, much like members of the antebellum Mississippi Valley elite, staked their very existence on the strength of southern economic connections to Latin America.  Cubans such as José Agustín Quintero deftly navigated volatile Mexican politics when they represented southern interests in Mexico primarily through vigorous cotton trade.  Evan Rotheras paper illustrates that southern interest in Latin American economic opportunities did not abate in the wake of the Civil War.  Instead, writers employed newspaper and literary forums to present places such as Mexico as a viable alternative to Reconstruction-and southerners believed these reports.  Former Confederates like Nathaniel Beverley Tucker sought to rebuild their lives in Mexico when they began new occupations as newspapermen and immigration agents.  These four papers use archival material from the United States, Mexico, Cuba, Peru, and Brazil to illustrate that nineteenth-century southerners looked south, as well as east and west, in their efforts to ensure survival of the South.  Furthermore, this research reminds scholars that Latin Americans sometimes leveraged that southern interest for their own purposes.</p>","Economics And Politics: Civil War Era Latin American Relations With The Southern U.S."

In the ensuing three decades, the history of emotions has emerged as one of the most innovative subfields in the American historical profession.  A growing body of literature on emotions such as homesickness, anger, and American cool has covered time periods as disparate as the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the early Cold War.  Since 2014, a book series at the University of Illinois Press has published several important monographs on emotions history, with more entries soon to follow.Despite the exciting work being done on the history of emotions in the American context, there remains a great deal of research to be done specifically on the emotions of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.  Since Jackson Lears No Place of Grace (1981) identified the quest for intense experience as a key motivating force behind turn-of-the-century social change, the period has stood out as a time when emotions were perhaps uniquely important in shaping American society.  Never was oratory more orotund, propaganda more reckless, denunciation more bitter, reform more strident, declared Howard Mumford Jones in The Age of Energy (1971).  A people thus verbally unrestrained must have been filled with exuberance and wrath.  Yet historians still know little about what shaped American emotions, and how those emotions in turn changed American culture, during those years.Accordingly, this roundtable brings together several leading scholars in the history of emotions during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in order to help sketch the emotional landscape of those decades.  The panels chair, Frank Costigliola, is a former president of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations and one of the most innovative historians of emotions working today; his article on the role of emotions in shaping George Kennans contributions to the Cold War was published in the Journal of American History in 2016.  Jeremy C. Young, an assistant professor of history at Dixie State University, is the author of The Age of Charisma (2017), which argues that the modern emotional connection between leaders and followers in America grew out of a unique group of charismatic social movements prominent in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Brenton J. Malin, an associate professor of communication at the University of Pittsburgh, is the author of Feeling Mediated (2014), which centers on the role of radio technology in shaping American emotions in the early twentieth century.  Amy Louise Wood, a professor of history at Illinois State University, analyzes the role of feeling in intellectual, popular, and state treatments of the criminal, and contextualizes these treatments within emotional responses to industrial capitalism.  Together, these scholars will outline a framework for understanding the always passionate, often mercurial emotions of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era United States.</p>","Emotions In The Gilded Age And Progressive Era"

Scholars interested in popular history have also added television, film, and more popular forms to this list, but embodied engagements (that is, interactions where meaning is made at the site of the body) are often understudied. We assume that history (the narrative, the interpretive process) is kept separate from the knowledge-producing or appraising subject, who we still think of as a sort of blank slate, who learns about and makes meaning from the past quite apart from their own experience or sense of self. This omission has many reasons: bodies are messy; meaning made at the level of affect or emotion is highly personal and difficult to gauge. In recent years, scholars working in memory studies have begun to consider more deeply how history-making occurs at the intersection of many different experiential and constitutive contexts, but in these theoretical formations memory acts as a counternarrative to history, as opposed to a force that acts at the register of recognition.However, for better or for worse, Americans have been learning about and making sense of the past by touching it, wearing it, and feeling it for many years now. It is only recently that scholars working across several fields (history, performance studies, theatre studies, affect studies) have begun to take seriously the ways that people make historical meaning through embodied engagement. This panel will examine the way in which forms of history that involve the body as the primary site of discovery and meaning-making  (living history, reenactment, role-playing, fan culture, fashion), has intersected and interacted with its surrounding popular culture. It is not insignificant that these forms of historical knowledge-production have become more prominent as popular culture and consumer culture itself has become more robust, particularly with the post-60s turn across these fields, as scholars like Fred Turner and Thomas Frank have noted, towards individualized experience. Historical knowledge production must be considered in tandem with these developments, and embodied history is a particularly apt site at which to do so.Because embodied history is often practiced outside of formalized institutional settings, it is a particularly rich and variegated form of engagement, deeply dependent on its context. We are particularly interested in the ways in which these forms of historical meaning-making converge with subculture, consumption, and popular culture at large. On one hand, embodied engagements with history have the potential to highlight histories and actors that stand outside traditional narratives that are found in institutional historical settings, on the other, they are in danger of reproducing the kinds of inequities of power and representation that are evident within popular culture at large. The papers comprising this panel take seriously embodied engagement with history, considering how bodies and history interact and affect each other, keeping in mind that for many people, such forms of historical meaning-making are their primary modes of engagement with the past. </p>","Feeling Is Believing: Embodied Practices Of Popular History"

The reconstruction of post-war economies, the pressures of modernization, the search for state sovereignty, and the surge of participatory democracy changed the social, economic, and political dynamics of the Global South.  Meanwhile the United States and the Soviet Union strategized ways in which to win the hearts and minds of the Global South, competing for the design of the postwar world.  The Global Souths reaction to these initiatives forced the two superpowers to redefine their strategic agendas.  This panel focuses on the reactions that took place in Pakistan, Thailand and Colombia, and the public diplomacy strategies designed and implemented by the United States in order to respond to these initiatives.  Through the use of propaganda systems the United States was able to respond to challenges that threatened their regional Containment policies, impeding the spread of Communist, Socialist, and Nationalist agendas across the Global South.  By looking at the specific case studies of Pakistan, Thailand and Colombia, the papers on this panel demonstrate that the United States had to develop new institutional and programmatic strategies in order to execute propaganda systems that curved the discourse away from nationalist interests and toward the anti-Communist agendas favored by the United States.

Taking a bottom up view, the panel explores how and why white men and women have been drawn to conservative causes across the twentieth century. Looking at debates over race-suicide in the first decades of the century, Trent McNamaras paper probes how moralists constructed a biological and cultural case for large families in reaction to prevailing modernist ideas. Julia Bowes examines the place of gender and ideas about the family in the anti-statist activism of the Sentinels of the Republic during the 1920s. In her paper on the desegregation of hospitals in the Deep South in the 1960s, Karissa Haugeberg analyzes how the female-dominated profession of nurses responded to and negotiated this progressive change. Finally, Kathleen Belews paper explores the role women played in the white power movement amidst fall out from the Vietnam War, looking at the instrumental role women played in building the movement and the symbolic importance of white womanhood to the movement. Collectively, the papers draw upon the complementary methodologies of social history and intersectional analysis to offer new ways of understanding twentieth century political history. Using these analytical strategies, the panel is attendant to the ways identity politics has been produced by political groups and has been a product of how particular groups and communities encountered progressive social change.Each paper raises a distinct question about the forms in which we represent the past. Haugebergs paper considers how the spaces where we situate our historical analysis shape our understandings. Whereas histories of desegregation have either taken place in the suburbs, or studied the laws themselves, Haugebergs paper examines the workplace as a forum where progressive change was enacted, negotiated and experienced. Belew reflects on the ethical demands and challenges of recovering the violence of white supremacists. MacNamaras paper considers how ideas about mysticism and modernity have blended in fashioning political claims. Analyzing how the Sentinels of the Republic fashioned a particular rendering of the American Revolution to serve their political ends, Bowes contemplates how historians create political narratives to speak to the political questions of our own time.Parsing out the relationship between social change, identity and conservative causes, the panel studies diverse terrain and forms of history in pursuit of a common question. As a whole, the panel asks what can gender and race tell us about how and why diverse Americans became committed conservatives.</p>","Fighting Progressive Social Change: Gender, Race And The Making Of Conservatives In The Twentieth Century United States"

Colonial, settler, and later, vacationers and retirees share the same two tropes-  descriptions of the territory are frequently fanciful and picturesque, filled with either dreams of fortune, grandeur and glory or damning the malarial and festering swampland of grim misfortune. Within these narratives there is also the concept of Florida as the first discovered, last settled. As the historiography relates to indigenous peoples, there is the familiar Vanishing Indian motif, that the numerous peoples of the coast had simply vanished, victims of disease and enslavement. The last real Indians of Florida as one recent popular history called them, left in the early eighteenth century for Cuba. These types of settler stories help to justify their racial classifications of the Seminole peoples, attempting to deny their claims to territory while claiming the Seminole were either not really indigenous to Florida or by focusing on their intermarriage with African Americans to deny their legitimacy. This process of denying legitimacy to indigenous peoples is part of what ethnohistorian Jean M. OBrien has argued stubbornly remained in the consciousness and unconsciousness of Americans and a toxic brew of racial thinking.  The contact era of Florida history has stubbornly focused on the myths of Ponce de Leon, the slaughter of French protestants by Pedro Menendez de Aviles, and the importance of the presidio at St. Augustine. But often the story of Florida ignores or makes only brief mention of the indigenous peoples along the southern coast, in particular the mound builders near what is now Cape Canaveral and the Ais of the Indian river lagoon. The papers in this session will discuss these peoples and the important ways they engaged in the colonial encounter. In doing so, they will address what it means for a state to encounter an indigenous and colonial history that the chroniclers of La Florida clearly cannot ignore but cannot fully embrace. </p>","Firsting And Lasting In La Florida"

Yet policymakers must also understand the limits that different forms of history have for policy formation. Historical analogies are a particularly tempting refuge for policymakers who want to understand how to avoid committing past mistakes. But analogies can also have serious limitations in the hands of policymakers with poor historical sensibilities. If applied to situations that bear little resemblance to the original event, historical analogies are of low value in policy formation. In such cases, analogies can serve to confirm the ideological priors of the policymaker in question rather than help to shape cohesive policy.  The Vietnam War looms large in policy formation related to U.S. foreign relations. In particular, policymakers and their advisers who favor an American stance in the world characterized by prudence and restraint tend to draw lessons from Vietnam. Controversy over Americas role in the world today means that Vietnams lessons are increasingly relevant. This panel examines Vietnams place in historical thinking related to policy formation. From policymaking during the war, to postwar policy related to other Cold War battles, to post-9/11 foreign policy, the papers explore how policymakers use different forms of history, as well as the opportunities and limits that historical thinking poses for decision-making. By doing so they reflect on how historians can interact with the policymaking process.Thomas A. Reinstein of Temple University first examines how history applied to policy formation during the Vietnam War. Using recently-declassified documents, he compares hawkish policymakers use of various historical analogies with the intelligence communitys more measured reports using analyses of Hanois past performance. Although policymakers analogies merely served to confirm their preconceptions that the U.S. could win in Vietnam, the intelligence communitys use of history often accurately estimated Hanois future actions. But because these reports did not speak to policymakers pre-existing beliefs, they went ignored or unread.Gail Yoshitani of West Point follows by examining how Vietnam-related analogies applied to Latin American Cold War battlefields. She argues that Vietnam influenced how important Reagan administration officials, key congressional and military leaders, and much of the American public thought about U.S. foreign policy in Latin America during the early 1980s. Each group focused on different lessons from the Vietnam experience. In the end these lessons had a significant impact on Reagan administration policy in Latin America.Mark Lawrence of the University of Texas at Austin concludes by looking at how policymakers use Vietnams lessons in the modern age of terrorism. He examines the different forms of history that policymakers have applied to Vietnam while also determining its relevance for policymaking in a post-Iraq War world. In doing so he offers a framework for understanding how policymakers can use history in foreign relations.</p>","Forming Policy In Vietnams Shadow: Historical Thinking And The Usable Past"

In assessing the evidence that tell us these stories this panel interrogates sources that enliven the interpretation of struggles in enslaved fugitivity. These historical inquiries require analysis of an array of discursive forms taken from legal,political, and economic structures involved in upholding the slave system. The presentations in this session highlight the connections and resonances of enslaved peoples experiential worlds across time and space as they attempted to exercise political autonomy.

The case study will be Chicagos ethnic neighborhoods during a period of 100 years—from 1910 to 2010. Both sets of scholars have studied the patterns of migration, community creation, and displacement of Chicagos African American, Assyrian, Eastern European, Iraqi, Jewish, and Latino communities and will employ their research to highlight some of the first-person perspectives through which immigrants and migrants in Chicago neighborhoods have created, been affected by, and are maintaining aspects of the culture they have brought to the United States in the process of becoming American. Before World War I, Chicagos steel mills, factories, and stockyards attracted large number of workers primarily from eastern and southern Europe. When immigration from those countries was blocked by the First World War, large numbers of African Americans, Mexicans, and white Appalachians moved north, literally changing the complexion of Chicago. With the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (also known as the Hart-Celler Act), the face of immigration changed once again, as new immigrants from Africa, Asia, and Latin America made Chicago their new home. By the end of the 20th century, Chicagos immigrant population was as high as its native population, with large numbers of migrants from India, Mexico, and the Philippines living in neighborhoods that remain distinct from those inhabited by descendants of earlier migrants from Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and the American South. On the one hand, Chicago has claimed the successful incorporation and assimilation of these immigrants. However, anthropologists and historians have also documented the existence of hostility and otherizing, which have long been part of American migration and displacement, and which Gwendolyn Brooks (herself the daughter of African Americans who moved to Chicago as part of the Great Migration) describes so well in her poems, especially A Street in Bronzeville (1945).   Of particular interest to both anthropologists and historians are the dynamics of incorporation and assimilation. As noted by William I. Thomas and Florian Znaniecki some 100 years ago in The Polish Peasant in Europe and America (1918–1920), Polish immigrants to Chicago adapted first to Polonia, an intermediate neighborhood that was neither wholly Polish nor wholly American, but rather something in between. Once these Polish immigrants had become acclimated to Polonia, they found it much easier to adjust to American society at large. Their struggles to maintain Polish identity while also becoming American were directly tied to the physical neighborhoods and communities in which they were residing.  This roundtable discussion will help demonstrate the variety of ways not only in which anthropologists and historians conceive and present their work, but also how can learn from each other in order to improve their analysis and interpretation of topics that are of mutual interest and concern. </p>","Forms Of History And Anthropology In The Study Of Chicagos Ethnic Neighborhoods"

Focusing on several historically significant communities in central Florida and southwest Georgia, panelists explore a variety of narrative forms that town promoters—past and present—deployed to promote and define their communities to each other and to the outside world. From the late nineteenth century to the present, these forms of public memory have created appealing mythologies and supplied strategies of empowerment and self-definition. Such narratives were written literally and metaphorically in newspapers and tourism materials, on plaques, in murals, in monuments, in historic preservation, in commemorative festivals, and in urban design. While many of these public texts have been intentionally created by historical societies, writers, municipalities or and booster associations, others are unintentional stories evident only through their absence, or implied in the very brick and mortar of a streetscapes placement, a buildings location in the landscape or decisions about preservation.   The panel explores the power dynamics inherent in these historical forms.  All three panelists engage themes of race, class, heritage tourism, and community development to show how different constituencies created and mobilized narratives about local history. In central Florida, African Americans in Gilded Age Winter Park deployed their own narratives of freedom as they tried to take advantage of the New South opportunities the region presented.  Julian Chambliss describes how African American residents used their newspaper, the Winter Park Advocate, to shape public perception of their community.  Scot French shows how, in Eatonville, a historically black central Florida community incorporated in 1887, town promoters have consistently invoked exceptionalist myths that obscured the more complex histories of the town and its deep connections to surrounding communities. Emily Mieras compares the dominant narratives about DeLand, Florida, and Thomasville, Georgia that early promoters created in the late nineteenth century to draw wealthy white northerners to these areas, promoting narratives of white pioneers and racial harmony that belied far more complex (and conflicted) racial and class realities.  Each of the panelists illuminates historical narratives that emerged in early town promotion but that have also shaped contemporary understandings of local identity. In DeLand and Thomasville, dominant narratives highlighted white pioneers at the expense of African American stories, a pattern that continues to the present day. In Eatonville and Winter Park, African Americans deployed varied strategies to present their communities to the public and forge a legacy for the future, practices that shaped contemporary community identities and claims to heritage tourism. The early forms of town promotion in all these communities resonate in contemporary versions. The elisions and mythologies of the earlier era continue to shape tourism and local branding today. By illuminating the origins and layers of these historical narratives, the panel suggests possibilities for complicating these stories in the present. </p>","Forms Of History And Community Forms: Race, Place, And Historical Narratives In The New South"

As debates about womens rights and freedoms became more heated in the wake of second-wave feminism, and as more women gained greater self-determination, the decisions women made about reproduction and childrearing were inflected by a highly politicized public sphere. These three papers address the intersection of postwar feminism, womens decision-making, and broader political debates. Examining the social environment in which hormonal birth control emerged from the 1940s through the 1960s, Kate Grauvogel considers how birth control became a source of tension: at once an emblem of sexual freedom and a source of health concerns regarding its possible side effects. As Grauvogel argues, feminists often interpreted any criticism of the pill on health grounds as a critique of social progress, which served to limit discussions of other birth control options. Sarah Rowley explores the cultural politics of abortion in the 1970s, a time when a cultural fascination with the 1950s in popular culture often served conservative goals. Arguing that abortion debates were deeply imbedded in a politicized cultural obsession with the past, Rowley examines how abortion rights and anti-abortion activists both framed their arguments around nostalgic versions of the American past. Leslie Paris examines a counterculture that began well before the 1960s and has continued to grow: the natural parenting movement. As Paris argues, this history reflected a widening skepticism about traditional male medical authority. While the movement was a source of judgement and anxiety for some, it served a wide range of women who invoked it to achieve a range of communal, political, and economic goals</p>","Gendered Cultures And Countercultures: Contraception, Abortion, And Mothering In The Postwar Years"

This panel proposes to change the form of history in which age is a central feature.  Rather than treating age as way to mark chronology, we will consider age as a category that structures broader narratives of power and politics.  Throughout American history, age has, in one way or another, shaped how historical actors exercised political power, how their politics were perceived, and the acceptable range of their political expression.  The voting rights, citizenship, political styles, and modes of political protest of children, Old Maids, grandmothers, and young adults were all in various ways dependent on ideas about the particular ages at which individuals can be political and, if they can, how.  This panel will feature scholars of youth and the elderly, exploring the ways in which age, together with race, sexuality, and gender, has functioned as a political identity and as a factor in shaping political possibilities in a democracy.  Drawing on speeches, organizational records, and political tracts, Corinne Field, Assistant Professor of Women, Gender & Sexuality at the University of Virginia, will reveal how white and black woman suffragists re-purposed the categories of grandmother and old maid to claim political power between 1870 and 1900.  Vanessa May, Associate Professor of History at Seton Hall University, will examine how ideas about age, gender, and sexuality shaped the policy-making power of Dr. Martha May Eliot, who became Childrens Bureau Chief in 1951 at sixty years old.  Miya Carey, a doctoral candidate in History at Rutgers University, will approach the analysis of age in history from the perspective of adolescent black girls engaging the Civil Rights Movement from within single-sex youth programs.  James Marten will comment.  Marten, Professor and Chair of the History Department at Marquette University, has written prolifically on the history of children and is the current editor Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth.

The instrumental logics of modern institutions, he believed, had deprived the world of mystery and had stripped it of much of the anthropocentric significance on which human societies had always anchored belief. Freud later inverted Webers formulation, arguing that civilization itself—far from removing the scales of enchantment from moderns eyes— precipitates a raft of irrationalities at odds with the Enlightenment project of reason.  In the decades since, understandings of the modern mind have largely gravitated to these two poles— ambivalent or sometimes celebratory accounts of demystification on one hand and more pessimistic renderings of the modern mind as beset by the spooks of capitalist modernity on the other.This panel seeks to complicate both of these paradigms.  Not only did modernity not disenchant the world, but modern forms of enchantment have defied reduction to the pathologies and coping mechanisms of modern life. Nan Enstads paper explores a form of enchantment lying paradoxically at the very heart of Webers supposedly rational modern bureaucracy— corporate personhood. Examining the 1890 incorporation of the American Tobacco Company, she shows how the market and nation-state breathed life into the corporate golem with magical implications for the wider culture. Similarly, Christopher Whites paper highlights entwinement of rationalization and enchantment by focusing on the magical effects of a ubiquitous piece of mid-20th century consumer technology— the television. Analyzing the construction of televisual space in science fiction programming and the conflation of spiritual and electrical energies by televangelists, he argues that TVs served as conduits for an imagined, spiritualized elsewhere.  Whites focus on media is mirrored in Jacques Vests paper, which argues for an increasingly enchanted understanding of recorded sound in the decades after the technologys introduction in 1877.  Audiences came to understand recorded sound in terms that emphasized the immanence of recorded subjects and the commensurability of self and other.  Finally, Rivka Maizlish explores the tension between science and enchantment through the Texas Folklore Society, which broke away from the national organization in 1924. Led by University of Texas professor J. Frank Dobie, the TFS rejected the scientistic pretensions of Franz Boas and others and elevated imagination and enchantment over professionalization and standardization.If, as Bruno Latour has argued, moderns have never successfully disentangled mind and object, then disenchantment and re-enchantment must be transcended in favor of more nuanced language. Instead of an enchanted on/off switch in the historical mind we confront the possibility of shades, registers, and modes of enchantment; of complex overlapping temporalities of ebb and flow; and a diffusion of narrative and political valences for these forms of enchantment. Enchantment becomes, in this telling, a more historical story than those told by Weber or Freud. By juxtaposing different phases of modern enchantment, this panel brings into focus some of the broad contours of this more heterogenous narrative.</p>","Haunted Modernity: Modes Of Enchantment In Nineteenth And Twentieth Century America"

The University of Texas Textbook Review Committee, which consisted of six members under the guidance of Dr. Emilio Zamora, in collaboration with twenty-six other renowned scholars of Mexican American history from across the country, participated in the review, tabulation and final analysis of over 700 errors found within the textbook written and submitted by Momentum Instruction LLC. The roundtable will foreground the events within the larger context of debates over education reform beginning with the 2010 Texas K-12 revision of social studies standards and the instrumental role of the National Association of Chicana and Chicano Studies (NACCS), its Texas chapter known as NACCS Tejas Foco, and its affiliates in developing a Mexican American Studies K-12 curriculum. Participants will discuss in detail the public hearing process as well as the significance of the recorded testimonies. Public testimonies reveal the solidarity of an inter-ethnic coalition of community members including academics, politicians, students, and concerned citizens against the textbook as they passionately revealed the detrimental personal effects of learning a flawed and incorrect history.

Just as the history of the NPS and its parks intersects with many aspects of U.S. history, so too do the agencys collections of historical documents, photographs, architectural plans, and artifacts. Research materials held by the NPS primarily relate to the acquisition, development, and operation of the national parks and to the history of the events and landscapes that the parks commemorate, preserve, and interpret. But these collections are potentially useful not only to historians of the parks, the environment, and tourism, but also to scholars studying westward expansion, urban planning, the New Deal, the Civil War, historical memory, race relations, Progressivism, womens history, maritime history, and many other topics. Many historians outside of the NPS are unaware of the agencys archival and museum collections, while others are unsure how to gain access. This panel will introduce the types of historical research materials in the parks, libraries, and service centers of the National Park Service (NPS), discuss how to identify and access these materials, and  identify under-examined sources and research topics. Panelists will also provide examples of how scholars have used NPS collections to explore a variety of topics in American history, and explore how research in NPS collections can reach beyond academia to shape the agencys research, operations, and policies. </p>","Historical Research In The National Parks: Resources And Opportunities"

Dissatisfied with Nixon and Vietnam War 1970, the two subjects of my film spent several months in Europe and Africa searching for and interacting with alternative political systems.In 1971 in Accra, Ghana, Steve Ewert woke up in a cold sweat. Bugs crawled out his mouth. Fear gripped his very soul. Im losing my mind! he cried repeatedly to his travel companion, Dick Russell. What started out as two young Kansas kids setting out to find themselves, turned to disillusionment and danger. Photographer Ewert and writer Russell trekked across Europe &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; fashion—meeting political figures, writers, photographers, and anarchists. Along the way, thieves stole their VW Bugs (twice!) and police almost arrested the pair in Amsterdam. If they were looking for unique experiences, Ewert and Russell certainly found them.But the most fascinating and dangerous part of the trip started when the pair crossed the Mediterranean and hitchhiked across the Sahara Desert, a 3000 mile trip that started in revolutionary hotspot Algeria and ended in sub-Saharan Ghana. With Ewert taking numerous pictures with his Nikon F and Russell prodigiously writing on his trusty Smith Corona Skyriter, the duo eventually took a ride with a multilingual Dutch revolutionary who would triumphantly quote from Chairman Maos &quot;Little Red Book.&quot; Eventually, they made it out of the desert despite being perilously close to perishing more than once. &quot;Hitchhiking to the Edge of Sanity&quot; is their story of adventure, discontent, and, ultimately, friendship.</p>","Hitchhiking To The Edge Of Sanity"

Population decline from Old World diseases, the mystical role of medicine people, public health problems on reservations, and the forced sterilization of American Indian women are a few of the most frequently studied issues. Many such studies unfortunately treat Native people and knowledge in isolation, absent the historical, social, and cultural contexts from which they emerge. The papers in this panel demonstrate the importance of studying American Indian health and wellness within the context of national and international developments, linking discrete moments and key episodes to broader trends in medicine, politics, and popular culture. The session shows that familiar topics within Native American history, namely Indian removal, representations of Indianness, and federal assimilation policies can be productively reconsidered by examining them through the lens of health and well-being. The papers simultaneously demonstrate how subjects within broader U.S. history and the history of medicine, such as the 1830s cholera outbreak, 19th-c. debates on medical and social reform, and the 1918 influenza pandemic, can be fruitfully explored from the perspective of American Indian studies. The session further demonstrates how discourses of power and identity were formed and reformed at the intersection of indigeneity and medicine. The proposed panel consists of three presentations on American Indians and the history of medicine ranging from the antebellum period through the end of World War I. Paul Keltons work focuses on the experiences of indigenous people during the era of Indian removal. His paper explores the role that cholera played during the forced internment and migration of Native communities from their eastern homelands to Indian Territory. Kelton argues that Indian suffering in the cholera outbreak was not the result of deficient immunity but was a direct consequence of a national policy of ethnic cleansing. Had eastern Indians been permitted to remain in their ancestral territories where they could manage the impact of the outbreak, a real American medical tragedy might have been avoided. Angela Pulley Hudsons study considers the emergence of Indian doctresses as urban medical practitioners during the middle of the 19th century. She investigates how these women (some Native, some not) performed Indianness in the context of an exploding market in healthcare, analyzing how their identities and activities shaped and were shaped by popular notions of indigenous womanhood. Her paper focuses on a series of these urban entrepreneurs from the 1840s through the 1870s, examining their careers in the context of mid-century reforms. Mikaëla Morgane Adamss paper addresses the devastating influenza pandemic at the end of World War I by focusing on its spread to the Haskell Institute, an Indian boarding school. She explores the impact of the disease on students, staff, and their families, using their experiences to illuminate the aggressive assimilation policies that underlay the operation of such institutions. Adams argues that the influenza outbreak at Haskell allows us to consider how the guardian/ward rhetoric of federal Indian policy influenced Native health and well-being.</p>","Indigenizing American Medical History: New Approaches To Health And Sickness In Native America"

This modified paper session examines the various kinds of legal borderlands that this produced and that Indigenous peoples in the North American West were forced to negotiate on a variety of scales. Organized around the three papers described below with two discussants, Erik Meeks and Michel Hogue, the session will function more like a roundtable, with all five participants taking just ten minutes to address the themes raised in the papers before opening the discussion to the audience. Jeff Shepherds paper reflects on ways in which members of the Blackfoot Confederacy negotiated both the U.S.-Canada border and reservation boundaries, as well newly imposed racialized identities. Brian Frehner considers ways in which Choctaw people responded to the imposition of exploitative legal structures intended to facilitate the taking of natural resources from their reservation, in some cases turning them to their own purposes and empowering themselves. Andrea Geiger examines the courtroom itself as a legal borderland and site of both cultural contact and colonial encounter, drawing on a series of linked cases in which five indigenous men were charged with murder in Alaska in 1902 after a traditional legal sanction imposed on another member of their community went awry.</p>","Indigenous Legal Borderlands In North America"

What impact have laws, including the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, had on relationships? What have Indigenous communities gained from relationships with the NPS: are there noteworthy successes or illustrative challenges that remain unresolved?

The influx of new pedagogy promises to reach audiences outside the academy as well as reshape the discipline and how it communicates historical accounts.  Our panel seeks to build on these developments and articulate how the increasing intersection of public and digital histories affect how graduate students produce scholarship, how they will teach their own courses, and how to contribute to the discourse of what it means to be a humanities scholar in the twenty-first century.   Our panel discussion examines three themes: reaching public history audiences, how and what the fine arts and liberal arts can teach each other about digital communication, and the emerging field of digital public humanities.  Matthew Reeves discussion takes on the challenge of exploring the concept of double empathy and argues that historians must deploy empathy for both their subjects and modern audiences.  Marc Reyes contribution discusses what he learned assisting a course outside the history department and what digital media, design, and history departments can learn from each other to produce cutting-edge scholarship and greater digital media literacy.  Emily Estens presentation blazes a new path by probing the relationship between digital public humanities and traditional historical scholarship and how historians are shaping critical digital pedagogy. All three approaches – audience empathy, digital interdisciplinary, digital public humanities – offer historians novel interpretive tools and insights for our cacophonous digital age.    Panel chair Tom Scheinfeldt, a pioneer in the field of digital humanities, will provide the contextual frame for the assembled papers and guide the discussion.  This panel, consisting of graduate students at different phases of their training, intends to examine the intersection of public and digital histories and what that means for the humanities both inside and outside the classroom.  Despite the OAH Programming Committees concerns regarding all graduate student presenters, we feel our panel necessary to comment on real-time changes in the training of historians and what these changes mean for the future of the discipline.  Our field is constantly changing, and the OAH is changing with it: increased audio/video recording and indexing represents a best practice for making information accessible within the profession and for the public.  As current graduate students with experience in the classroom and with public-facing projects, we are excited for these changes and our papers explore similar emerging practices.  Our panel answers the OAHs call for presentations that explicitly address new ideas for the classroom and redefine the boundaries of modern digital scholarship.

These individuals – Arturo Schomburg, William Henry Dorsey, and L. S. Alexander Gumby – were deeply invested in both preserving the historical achievements of people of African descent and creating a record of people and events that could be used to study African American history. Intended for a range of private and public audiences, the collections that they amassed became part of a broader argument about the contributions of Black people to world history and U.S. culture.In keeping with the theme of the 2018 OAH Annual Meeting, this panel examines the forms and functions of history when used to establish and preserve a historical record during the strengthening of Jim Crow policies. The process of constructing and then using African American history over the course of several decades during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries enables scholars to better understand the political functions of African American archives and historical memory.Each of the three panelists focus their paper on a Black collector and explain the intended purposes of their collections, the creators archival methodologies, and the diverse ways in which individuals used these collections. The paper presented by Melanie Chambliss analyzes the now-famous collection of Arturo Schomburg whose documents became the foundation of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York City. She writes about Schomburgs work of historical recovery using diverse sources of Black history that Schomburg assembled to produce a non-traditional form of history that centered the lives of African descended people. Aston Gonzalezs paper traces the growth of the collection amassed by Black Philadelphian William Henry Dorsey who collected hundreds of thousands of visual, textual, and material records of African American intellectuals and politicians during and after the Civil War. White and Black Americans studied his collection, W. E. B. Du Bois used its materials to write his landmark study The Philadelphia Negro, and Dorsey donated much of his archive to one of the first historical societies established to preserve and celebrate African American history. Kristin Gilgers essay scrutinizes the production of more than 150 scrapbooks by L. S. Alexander Gumby, a largely understudied figure of the Harlem Renaissance. She writes about the community that he fostered as he entertained prominent Black artists in his home and the collective Black identity that he modeled in his voluminous scrapbooks.The papers on the panel explore and answer questions at the foundation of the historical practice. They provide scholars with three examples by which to study the multifaceted relationships between historical actors and those who recorded their actions. The panel offers insights into the intent and methodologies of Black archivists, the evidence they compiled, and the audiences to which they aimed their sometimes radical racial and political appeals. </p>","Intervention And Recovery: Assembling Black Archives In The United States"

We mine the black press for civil rights stories; we read newspaper headlines to confirm our sense of the national and international events that mattered; and we write the histories of papers of record, such as the New York Times and Washington Post, that are still widely read.  Yet our notions of what must be important can blind us to the actual media landscape of the past.  This panel assembles three projects that reconstruct the print media of the Gilded Age and Progressive era.  The three papers ask simple questions that reveal new stories: what kinds of media actually traveled through the mail?  What array of newspapers did Americans actually read?  What stories and morals did print media actually communicate each day? Cara Caddoos paper considers the black weeklies of Memphis, Tennessee.  One of these, the Free Speech, is known almost entirely for Ida B. Wellss editorials that denounced the practice of lynching.  But Caddoo looks beyond these few famous editorials to the everyday contents of Memphiss black weeklies and finds something else—a constant emphasis on property as a symbol of security and success.  Richard Popps study assesses postal traffic to reveal an enormous trade in cheap magazines—essentially, Gilded Age junk mail.  Popp turns the 1870s and 1880s media market itself into the story, and takes a fresh look at the kinds of materials that millions of Americans received in their mail boxes.  His paper finds a center of publishing not in New York or Chicago but in Augusta, Maine, and trawls the flimsy pages of the Peoples Literary Companion rather than the glossy pages of Cosmopolitan or McClures magazine. Julia Guarneris paper examines the Hearst chain of newspapers but looks beyond the companys flagship titles and past Hearsts most brazen decades of sensational journalism.  Hearsts papers of the 1910s and 1920s, mostly operating in medium-sized cities, contain little remarkable journalism. Yet their business model—which catered to local tastes using a nationalized, generic template—allowed a mass media to win over varied audiences throughout the United States. All three panelists get at hidden stories by paying attention to the economics of media.  Caddoo is interested not only in the economic lessons that the black press taught its readers, but also in the economy that made the black press possible; she discusses the ways that black owners and readers used their own properties to produce and consume the news.  Popp studies the material economy of junk mail alongside the economic rationale for blanketing the country with cheaply-produced magazines.  Guarneri shows how, in an era of mergers and syndication, a concern for the bottom line produced generic yet profitable city papers.  Because economics are central to our questions about media, we have asked Richard John to serve as commentator.  We look forward to hearing Johns take, as a historian of media and business, on the media landscapes that we evaluate in our papers.</p>","Junk Mail, Generic Papers, And Real Estate News: The Unread Media Of The Gilded Age And Progressive Era"

In the sixteenth century, the area now known as California was the most diverse area in North America, boasting a population of between 300,000 and 1,000,000 people and nearly 100 different languages.  Beginning in the late eighteenth century, Spanish, Mexican, Russian and American invaders imposed their own colonial regimes on Indigenous people, which included forced labor, reductions to missions, ethnic cleansing and genocide.  The invasion of California precipitated a catastrophic population decline; perhaps 30,000 California Indians survived the waves of colonists.  In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, California Indian people reconstituted their communities through wage labor and purchasing land, and constructed the foundation for the revitalization of their nations in the late twentieth century.  In 1988, the Supreme Court case California vs. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians opened new possibilities for American Indian gaming.  Today, California has the largest population of American Indians in the United States.  California Indian history has been at the middle of debates about the past.  Recently, scholars have centered California in histories of genocide, ethnic cleaning and violence, the structure of settler colonialism and the dynamics processes by which Indigenous peoples practiced survivance and persistence.  This panel addresses those historical and contemporary significance of American Indians in California.  This panel examines the forms and politics of California Indian history.  It pays attention to the different historical methods and sources that exist in California Indian communities, such as land and basketry.  In addition, it explores how California Indians deploy their histories to reinterpret the past, fight for land and protect resources.  William Bauer argues that California Indian used their oral traditions to discuss and interpret their past, present and future.  Concows possessed a visual understanding of the past; when they saw their landmarks they could recall stories about their history.  Concows then used these histories to reinterpret California history and claim land in the Sacramento Valley.  Vanessa Esquivido-Meza considers the gendered labor involved in making baskets.  Esquivido-Meza positions California Idnain women at a the center of a story involving land, plants and history. Finally, Khal Schneider examines the legacies of treaty making in California.  In the 1850s, California Indians signed treaties with the United States, but the Senate failed to ratify the documents.  In 1929, the Indians of California sued the United States for the land claims.  In order to grain compensation for these ungratified documents, California Indians and reformers crafted a version of the states history that supported Indigenous rights and politics.All three presenters are members of California Indian communities.

Their research has now created a complex and convincing narrative of urban life that hinges on the turning points of the American story; Revolution, the Rise of Capitalism, Civil War, Great Migrations, Great Depressions, Post-War Crisis, and Civil Rights.At the same time, those scholars who do not consider themselves urbanists are now deeply engaged in the project of writing histories that situate America in transnational and global places and that acknowledge the spatial turn.  Now underway is a three-part Cambridge History of America and the World, a series that will certainly institutionalize some of these trends in the field.   Over the past few years the OAHs annual meeting has incorporated an increasing number of panels approaching issues from a transnational and urban perspective.  Often, urban historians have been part of these efforts that have nevertheless principally focused on the twentieth century.Now is the time to move towards a more expansive inquiry into American cities and the global urban panorama.  Producing such a history is certainly an ambitious project.  However, the small scale of the individual city lends itself to providing insights into how large-scale, global, processes play out at ground level.  Indeed, it is precisely the potential of cities to address the scalar issues that are at the heart of global history that makes the project of a global urban history so compelling.  Fulfilling this potential requires American urban historians to reach across not only national borders, but also the time and space of the U.S. past.  In this spirit, our round table brings together five scholars who, with their expertise, cover this past between 1600 and 2000.  All are committed to realizing the potential of global urban history in an American setting.  The brief presentations of each participant will leave ample time for discussion of the issues involved in pursuing large-scale projects such as these.  It is our hope that both the panel and the audience will benefit from an improved understanding of the central issues, benefits, and questions involved in approaching the American urban past on a global scale.</p>","Large Scale Forms Of U.S. Urban History"

By that we mean that religion is fundamental to understanding Latina/o politics and social movements in the United States. The pendulum of Latina/o religious politics oscillates between a strict adherence to fundamentalist thought and an acknowledgement of religions liberative force. Two sides of the same coin that are critical to understanding Latina/o religious politics. But religion is never just an institutional force with strict gatekeepers; its historical power has come from the people—from those who sit in the pews—and from clergy whos reading of the Biblical text has moved them to political action. This is where we believe our paper session can contribute to ongoing conversations about Latina/o civil rights and politics in the 1970s. This is a conversation that we believe is sorely needed because the linkage of faith or religion to political activism has been a sorely neglected field in Latina/o history. Latina/o historians like others in Latina/o Studies seem to believe—incorrectly—that faith and politics represent two separate spheres. Yet in reality, faith, both Catholic and non-Catholic has been an important aspect of Latina/o political history, but one not well documented. Faith-based movements have been documented with respect to César Chávez and the farm workers movement; Reies López Tijerina and the land grant movement in New Mexico in the late 1960s; and of Católicos Por La Raza in Los Angeles as a Chicano Movement faith-based group. Some similar documentation has also occurred with respect to some Protestant groups. As a whole, however, the linkage between faith and politics remains a large gap in Chicana/o and Latina/o historiography. Our paper session brings together historians from around the United States and the Netherlands for a conversation on the central role Latina/o religious politics has played in major cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, and Houston. Anne Martinez will present a paper on her research on the via crucis reenactments in Pilsen, the long-established Mexican neighborhood in Chicago, where the via crucis has been performed since the late 1970s. She challenges notions that religion serves as a palliative, rather than a source for community formation toward activism. Mario T. Garcia will present a paper on his on-going biography of Fr. Luis Olivares who is best known for being the key leader of the sanctuary movement in Los Angeles in the 1980s. Garcia will explore Olivares earlier experiences with faith-based politics with the United Neighborhoods Organization (UNO) from 1975 to 1980 and prior to his engagement with the sanctuary movement. Felipe Hinojosa will present a paper on how urban renewal programs and white flight brought together two unlikely allies in a struggle to deal with a changing neighborhood in Houston&quot;s Northside. White Presbyterians and Mexican American activists negotiated the politics of a neighborhood in transition even as they fiercely debated the role the church could and should play in community activism, politics, and social change. </p>","Latina/O Religious Politics In The 1970s: Suffering, Hope, And Activism"

Historians of women and gender have consistently challenged this binary. This panel contributes to that revisionism by considering the ways in which the family was actively constructed in relation to large-order projects of commodification. Taking moments of enslavement, insolvency, and inheritance as their respective points of departure, the papers on this panel offer new perspectives on the history of the domestic realm and illuminate fresh links between race, gender, and the history of capitalism.Jessica Marie Johnson examines French Atlantic codes and statutes which sought to legislate sex between African women and European men. By engaging practices of sex and manumission in the Caribbean before the 1685 Code Noir, Johnson considers ways African women navigated out of bondage alongside anxieties expressed by colonial officials over how to deal with the mixed-race offspring in their midst. Alisha Hines considers black women who took on the legal posture of white men in antebellum court rooms by claiming and pursuing protection of their right to property. In the cases she considers, black women employed the language of property and possession to claim rights to their children and their childrens labor. These particular performances of legal personhood are significant in the context of a multiplicity of legal avenues that were available to black women in pursuit of their freedom and freedom for their kin. She hopes to explore the ways in which accessing certain scripts in the antebellum legal theater shaped and re-shaped black womens notions of gender, family, and freedom. Daniel Platt examines the history of property exemption law in the postbellum period, focusing on how borrowers and lenders struggled to fix the ambit of the generous legal protections afforded to insolvent heads of family households. Confronted with a diversity of unconventional family forms, jurists weighed kin-based definitions of the domestic against dependency-based definitions, ultimately privileging hierarchical models of family life drawn from pro-slavery discourse. These cases show, the surprising durability of pre-emancipation legal logics and the role of market entanglements in concretizing the family as a usable legal category in the Gilded Age.The new history of capitalism has drawn attention to under examined aspects of Americas economic past and has helped scholars recognize the centrality of the commodification of land, natural resources, and labor, especially reproductive labor, to the history of the Atlantic World. Questions of human agency and of the naturalizing power of different discursive tropes have recently received less attention, however. By exploring the entwined history of family, property, and market, this panel seeks to demonstrate the value of feminist analysis to the revived study of political economy as well as advance scholarship on the circuitous and contested history of natural domestic relations.</p>","Law, Family, And The Logics Of Commodification"

While prisons are, in general, state institutions, they do not present ready access to their archives. Much of what we know about what transpires inside of them owes to other sources: namely, prisoner testimonials or autobiographies, and court records. Episodic riots also provide occasional media reports. As the study of mass incarceration occupies increasing space in historical scholarship and classrooms, this roundtable investigates the forms and stakes of prison history. In particular, we will discuss the methodological and pedagogical challenges raised by putting prisons and prisoners at the center of analysis. The roundtable is occasioned by the publication of Rethinking the American Prison Movement (Routledge, forthcoming fall 2017). Aimed at undergraduate and high school audiences, this textbook is the first broad survey of prisoner activism between Reconstruction and the present. The book outlines different forms of prisoner activism in response to convict leasing, political repression, prison managerialism, and the shift from rehabilitative incarceration to punitive incapacitation. These include micropolitical challenges to prison slavery, lawsuits targeting religious persecution or sexual violence, spontaneous uprising against racism and violence, mutual aid networks to provide health care and peer education, and popular pressure campaigns waged by outside supporters to free incarcerated dissidents. This roundtable brings together scholars focused on different historical periods of study, from the late nineteenth century to the postwar period, to discuss how the function of prisons changed from one of forced labor to one of mass warehousing. It also connects traditional historians with scholars working in both legal studies and literary studies to discuss the different interpretive frameworks needed to research, write, and teach about prisons. We will consider the prison not only as a conceptual and physical space for making history, but also the ways in which scholars use forms of history to explore different modes of engaging prisons. We will also discuss the Prison Abolition Syllabus and other recent public history efforts, such as the States of Incarceration project at the Humanities Action Lab, which provide alternate modes of connecting this history to contemporary discussions about mass incarceration and prison abolition.</p>","Law, Resistance, And The Forms Of Prison History: Roundtable On Rethinking The American Prison Movement"

First, by emphasizing that for most of the last century, radicalism in the US has been based in multiple social movements not electoral parties. This social movement left has been more discontinuous and more innovative than its counterparts in most countries and operates in different ways, achieving influence through alliances and through channels that have often involved the Democratic Party. Second, by exploring the nations political geography. The left has mattered in some places much more than others and radical geography has changed over time. By paying attention to the institutional dynamics and geographic complexity of this social movement left, we gain a fuller understanding of how it has operated and what it has accomplished over the past century.</p>","Lawcha Luncheon & Annual Meeting: Remapping The History Of American Radicalism"

Historians isolate themselves in their research, test ideas at conferences, and make brief sojourns to libraries away from home. While academic conferences and scholarly publishing offer historians an opportunity to share their research with other academics, we must expand our understanding of collaboration beyond the peer review process. The profession is moving, albeit slowly, toward more inter-departmental, co-authored, and cooperative relationships. A 2004 Journal of American History roundtable highlighted the beneficial aspects of Interchange between scholars, and the various forms in which we present our research. Historians increasingly venture outside their offices, classrooms, and disciplines to collaborate on popular representations of history such as films, games, preservation sites, and graphic histories. These kinds of collaborations shift away from the lecturer-audience relationship, engage the public with different perspectives, invigorate our field, and invite people to share in the appreciation and study of history through different mediums. Working with various people and institutions, our panel concluded that collaboration is a necessity for producing physical and digital venues for teaching history. The majority of this presentation should be viewed as a case study of a graduate programs efforts to convey history to the public. Three of our panelists discuss their experiences working on the museum exhibit Ready to Roar. Shae Cox, the Project Manager, provides an in-depth discussion of the logistics for overseeing the accessioning, housing, handling, and display of material objects from six museums as well as individual lenders from across the nation. Alan Mattay, Ready to Roars Digital Curator, examines the collaborative process of creating an expanded digital exhibit for UNLVs public history website. Lee Hanover, Head of the Research Team for Ready to Roar, demonstrates the value of collaborative label writing that maintains scholarly research while being accessible to the general public. Billy Marino examines the contribution of his work, Atomic Liquors, to Intermountain Histories, a website and mobile application which brings together several regional universities as part of a collaborative digital history project. Mary Ruth Sanders reexamines how teaching--specifically teaching difficult topics such as the history of terrorism--benefits from a variety of collaborations on different levels. Associate professor of history at UNLV and the chair of the OAH Membership Committee, Michael Green, will chair and comment for this session. Our panel will experiment with the traditional academic conference format by incorporating digital, visual, and tactile components, which highlight various forms of collaboration as an integral facet of the stories we tell.</p>","Levels Of Collaboration: Presenting University Research Through Public And Private Institutions"

The lives of presidents and their wives after their departure from the executive mansion also have a history, and it deserves more attention. From Washington on, statesmen leaving the highest office have worried about the proper role of a former head of state while looking for ways to extend their influence or enhance their legacy. In an era before anyone thought of pensions for ex-presidents or their spouses and the very concept of retirement was in its infancy, what ways of obtaining an income were acceptable and what would shame them or tarnish their former office? Similarly, what forms of public service or attempts to benefit the nation with their experience would be beneficial and which would be dismissed as shameful, unworthy attempts to hang on to the loaves and fishes of office? A few presidents, such as John Quincy Adams and William Howard Taft, accepted elective or appointed office after leaving the White House, and even some former first ladies, such as Dolley Madison, found it possible to play a rather public role at the center of power. More often, statesmen and women who wished to remain involved in public affairs did so less directly and in a wide variety of ways.This session looks at the increasingly varied and complex role played by former presidents and their spouses. Featuring documentary editors from three prominent publishing projects, it presents test cases spanning more than a century, spread across different regions, and including both genders. Andrea R. Gray looks at Thomas Jeffersons involvement in all aspects of the highly visible effort to create a nondenominational, state-funded university while balancing this very public act against his strong desire for personal privacy and the tactical need to conceal his lobbying efforts from a legislature in which he still had many enemies. Ryan Semmes examines Ulysses S. Grants world tour, which has often been portrayed as a purely private sightseeing expedition, but which seems rather to have had wide-reaching diplomatic implications of which Grant was fully aware and which he hoped to use as a springboard to a third presidential term. Mary Jo Binker writes on the centrality of Eleanor Roosevelts Val-Kill home to her postwar career as a leading exemplar of human rights and democratic values using material drawn from her syndicated newspaper column, My Day. Burton Kaufman, the dean of historians of presidential retirements who is currently working on a biography of Barack Obama, will comment on the papers, point to the many ways that documentation for recent as well as older presidencies is now becoming accessible, and pull together the common threads and potential for further work before opening the session to discussion from the floor.</p>","Life After The White House"

A is Black, B is Jewish, C is Chinese, and so are all of the members of their respective families and kin groups, and so must they remain.  In the American West, many people have changed identities over the course of their lives, or over generations in families, as they have moved from one social context to another, or as new social rules have been imposed on them.  This is not racial, ethnic, or religious imposture.  It is simply the way that people&quot;s lives have unfolded in fluid social circumstances.  Spickard presents a theory for understanding the shape, means, and meanings of racial change, based on the life stories of several such shape shifters from the American West.Rana Razek, &quot;Between Arab and Black: Zammouri, Race, and Arab American Identity, examines competing narratives of Zammouri (Estebanico), the Muslim Moroccan slave brought to the Americas on the ill-fated 1527 Narváez expedition.  One of the few survivors, Zammouri was a translator, healer, guide, and scout, and was reportedly killed by Zuni Indians in what is now New Mexico.  Arab Americans and African Americans both lay claim to Zammouris legacy of discovery and conquest, in order to enhance their claim to inclusion.  For the Zuni, rather, Zammouri was a harbinger of conquest and colonial violence, and is memorialized as Chakwaina, the black monster kachina.  From the Native perspective, Zammouri represents the beginning of a long and violent history of colonization that continues to the present day.  For Arab and African Americans, Zammouris position as a Black/African/Arab/Muslim/Slave and non-European is essential to the story.  These opposing narratives speak to issues of race, power, and colonialism then and now.  Zammouris changing racial identity illuminates Arab American racialization and racial in-betweenness; if early twentieth-century Syrian Americans were positioned somewhere between Arab and White, today, Arab Americans have drifted demonstrably toward the dark end of the racial spectrum.David Torres-Rouff, &quot;West of Jim Crow: A Conceptual and Empirical Framework.&quot; What happens when Jim Crows structural function is separated from the crucible of Black-White relations in the post- Reconstruction South? I argue that policies and practices we call Jim Crow also arose in the North American Southwest beginning in the eighteenth century and developed within successively Spanish, Mexican, and American intercultural communities. Without recourse to chattel slavery as a touchstone for social, political, and economic relations, people in the Southwest developed institutions that defined and differentiated racial hierarchies; that sponsored unfree labor and imprisonment for profit; and that relied on legal and extralegal violence to impose social and spatial segregation. On what knowledge did Southern Whites rely when developing what we now call Jim Crow?  Did the Southwest provide a model, and did a direct transfer of knowledge take place? Addressing Jim Crow&quot;s long shadow requires a reckoning of its compound, multiregional origins and its multiracial history.</p>","Making Race In The American West"

Strict standards of informed consent spurred by the consumer and womens health movements reshaped the doctor-patient relationship. Simultaneously, a resurgence in midwifery challenged mainstream prenatal care and childbirth practices. But did these newly won rights extend to womens ability to make their own medical decisions during pregnancy and childbirth? Much of the literature on womens reproductive rights in the post-World War II era has focused on the legalization of and womens access to abortion and contraception.  These papers instead turn attention to the rights and status of pregnant women in the decades after Roe v. Wade and Eisenstadt v. Baird to reveal womens ability to make medical decisions about themselves, their fetuses, and their providers as a contested arena.Using a reproductive justice framework, this panel takes a fresh look at the state of pregnancy and maternity care in America in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing specifically on medical experimentation and the law. Heather Drons paper examines the FDA&quot;s effort to exclude pregnant and potentially pregnant women from clinical trials in the wake of the thalidomide disaster, leading to 1977 federal guidelines that banned testing of investigational drugs on women of childbearing potential. It then explores the long-term implications of this policy for pregnant women who consumed medications without knowing potential risks and benefits to themselves and their fetuses. Rebecca Kluchins paper tracks the rise of forced cesarean sections in the 1980s when hospitals and doctors asked courts to compel pregnant patients to accept medical treatment on behalf of their fetuses.  It demonstrates the extent to which the politics of fetal personhood shaped pregnancy and childbirth and compares the ways lawyers and doctors used Roe to make opposing claims: one side argued that Roe required women who chose to continue their pregnancies to sacrifice on behalf of their fetuses while the other side insisted that Roe granted women the right to prioritize their health over that of their fetus. Wendy Klines paper identifies legal pressure placed upon lay midwives in the mid-1970s, focusing in particular on the arrest of California midwife Kate Bowland for practicing medicine without a license.  Women demanded changes in their maternity care and midwives responded, but the state and organized medicine used the courts to block these efforts and employed Roe in their legal attempts to discredit lay midwives.  This paper studies the tensions this created among providers and the limits such lawsuits placed on womens choices in childbirth for decades thereafter. This panel will include three papers and a chair, but comments will be given by the audience only. Each scholar will have twenty minutes to deliver her paper and each paper will be followed by five minutes of audience questions.  The last fifteen minutes of the panel will be devoted to discussion between the audience and panel about all three papers.  This panel will be chaired by Jacqueline Wolf, an expert in womens health and medicine who has written extensively on childbirth in America.</p>","Maternal Health, Fetal Health And U.S. Law, 1970-1990"

They received strong push-back at the time, but weve come a long way since then.  In this current age of Fake News, the very phrase studies show prompts a skeptical response.  Rather than dismiss all science as equally skewed, historians can show what kind of politics certain lines of scientific inquiry promoted, and which moral and political values underlay specific scientific presumptions.  This interdisciplinary panel looks at different moments in the American past, when medical theories about the body and about disease served as ammunition for or against radical social projects.  The first paper highlights the links between chemistry and radical religious ideas.  Kirsten Fischer (Assoc. Prof., History, Minnesota) examines medical vitalism in the 1790s, according to which a vital power animates the tiniest particles of matter.  Some vitalists concluded that the bio-chemical processes of life required no transcendent Creator-God, and their vitalist theories led to a radical (and heretical) rethinking of Christianity and all other revealed religions.  Eric Herschthal (Ph.D. candidate, History, Columbia), by contrast, shows how medical theories hindered a radical project, namely abolition on a transnational scale.  Herschthal explains how medical explanations of yellow fever in the U.S. and Great Britain hampered the abolitionist movement in the 1790s and diminished hopes for Sierra Leone as an abolitionist colony.  Sari Altschuler (Assistant Prof., English, Emory) also focuses on theories of disease, but to different ends.  During the cholera pandemic of the 1830s, abolitionists deployed theories of the spread of cholera to oppose slavery.  Both Herschthal and Altschuler demonstrate that the way people understood the movement of microbes containing yellow fever and cholera shaped the racial politics in each case.  A comment on these papers will come from Joyce Chaplin (Prof., History, Harvard), a renowned expert on cultural histories of science.  We hope the audience will join us in a discussion of how to think about the intertwining of moral values, political agenda, and scientific projects, past and present.

Re-centering immigrants and their histories has been key, first to the cultural, and then the transnational turn, as migration, community formation, and the development of social identity have become touchstones of North American social and cultural history. The papers in this panel build on these developments, revealing new insights as to the forms of history as both practice and profession. As practice, the works to be presented suggest that exploring immigrants in their local contexts is an essential form of U.S. history, and one central to an ongoing evaluation of the meaning and nature of Americanness, the significance of political boundaries, and the strength of transnational ties. One paper reconstructs the material lives of Chinese in Californias Central Valley during the nineteenth century. The other three consider Latinx communities in Southern California and North Carolina, focusing on the impact of education, local networks, and cross-cultural connections. Together, these works extend the cultural and transnational turn to small-scale communities, revealing them to be the collective crucibles in which U.S. residents forged the meaning and texture of America. Each paper represents archival research conducted by undergraduate students. We suggest this is an important and often underappreciated form of history, one that reflects the convergence of teaching and research. Finally, these authors are all women, Latinas, and first-generation college students interested in pursuing a career in history, revealing the ways that changes in the subject and form of historical inquiry have the power to transform the profession itself. </p>","Migrant Communities, Transnationalism, And History As Practice And Profession"

By highlighting how colonial histories of various forms have shaped migration streams to the U.S., this work challenges notions of American exceptionalism by demonstrating how U.S. immigration patterns have resembled those of other imperial nations, such as that of Britain. This work also highlights the agency of migrants within the U.S. domain as a necessary part of a broader history of American empire that includes not only examples of state power but also claims of non-state actors, in particular those of migrants contesting racial ideologies, immigration laws, and discriminatory labor practices. This work, then, explores a history of empire shaped as much by the force of U.S. state power overseas as by the claims of colonial migrants within the United States. War, occupation, and economic upheaval pushed many people from the outer reaches of American expansion to the center of conflicts in the United States and its territories over colonialism, migration, labor, race and citizenship. Such migrations were marked by what historian Paul Kramer has described as asymmetries of power as migrants arriving in locations as diverse as California, New York and the Panama Canal, faced exploitative labor regimes and a variety of discriminatory laws. Yet in asserting claims to work, live, and become citizens in the United States, migrants desperate to find work in the domestic U.S. contested, at times successfully, the colonial categories that defined them as foreign. This work contributes to an emerging literature on the history of the U.S. in the world that shows not only the reach and power of Americas imperial ambitions but also its limits, as migrants challenged American labor regimes, racial ideologies, and immigration laws within the United States.Building on pioneering work at the intersection of imperialism and immigration in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries such as that of Paul Kramer, Dorothy Fujita-Rony, Catherine Choy, and Eiichiro Azuma, participants in this session will discuss their latest work in this field, ranging from the Caribbean to the Pacific, and facilitate a discussion with the audience on new directions in the field. Julie Greene (Chair) will speak on her current project entitled, Movable Empire: Labor Migrations the Making of U.S. Global Power, 1890-1934, which focuses on labor migration as a defining element of American expansion in the early twentieth century. Moon-Ho Jung will speak on his current project, entitled, The Unruly Pacific: Race and the Politics of Empire and Revolution, 1898- 1941, highlighting the role of migration and empire in racial formations. Reena Goldthree will speak on her recent work, A Greater Enterprise than the Panama Canal: Migrant Labor and Military Recruitment in the World War I-Era Circum-Caribbean, (Labor, Special Issue: Labor and Empire in the Americas, 2016) and Robert McGreevey will discuss his book, Borderline Citizens: The United States, Puerto Rico, and the Politics of Colonial Migration, 1898-1934, (forthcoming, Cornell University Press, 2018).</p>","Migration And Empire"

Moreover, increasing numbers of scholars are choosing non-academic careers. Historians narrative styles, too, have evolved to meet the challenges presented by 21st century economic and technological opportunities.  This panel brings together writers in various areas who are pushing the boundaries of their field, trying new narrative styles, and bringing history to new audiences.  Rachel Martin earned her PhD in gender and memory studies at the University of North Carolina, but abandoned the tenure-track hunt for a career as a freelance writer and researcher.  She has won awards (and made a New York Times What Were Reading list) for her work on the intersection of food, civil rights, and memory in Memphis.  What does it mean to be a writer with a PhD? she asks herself, and us.  Tyler Anbinder, professor of history at George Washington University, is attempting to turn census data and bank records into a compelling narrative that could appeal to non-academic readers.  Likewise, Jim Downs, associate professor of history at Connecticut College, is a pioneer in the field of medical history.  Winner of the Andrew Mellon New Directions Fellowship, Downs is currently studying medicine at Harvard University to illuminate his work on emancipation.  Finally, Michael Landis, assistant professor of history at Tarleton State University, aims to push the boundaries of political history and bring previous neglected voices into the political narrative.  His current work on Georgia in the 1850s-60s seeks to tell a comprehensive story that includes both women and men, black and white, enslaved and free, rich and poor.  Can a gripping political narrative contain all those voices at once while still offering a coherent argument? he asks.  The chair of the panel is Lora Burnett of Collin College.  A prolific blogger and student of US intellectual history, Burnett strives to bring nuanced intellectual and policy history to new audiences and engage the general public in serious historiographical debates.  As a leading figure in the Society for US Intellectual History, she is well-positioned to lead our discussion.  Overall, this panel is about the craft of writing. We will speak frankly about goals, successes, and failures, while also debuting new narrative approaches and possibilities.  More importantly, we hope to spark a productive discussion with the audience about the role of writing in the historical profession and the future of the narrative form in our discipline.  We are eager to hear audience comments and will maximize audience participation in the discussion.  Since the OAH is the leading coalition of American historians, we feel the 2018 annual meeting is the perfect venue for this much-needed discussion.</p>","Narrative Challenges In The Writing Of History"

This collection of thirty-four new historiographic essays covers the years between 1877 and 1920, a period which saw the U.S. emerge from the ashes of Reconstruction to become a world power. The volume and the authors in this round table present fresh interpretations of the period and its historiography. Nichols and Unger will provide a brief overview of the work, drawing from their introductory essay Gilded Excesses, Multiple Progressivisms.  This discussion will reveal the wide range of relevant specialties explored in the books essays.  Robert Johnston will kick off the specific contributors portion with a recap of his provocative essay Influential Works about the Gilded Age and Progressive Era, in which he reflects on the trajectory of major scholarly works on the period.  Even as the older emphasis on political culture and political economy has been superseded by a new focus on race, gender, and empire, enduring questions of democracy continue to be central. In her discussion of Gender, Kimberly Hamlin challenges the widely argued notion that the nineteenth-century concept of separate spheres for men and women eroded during the GAPE.  Hamlin argues that separate spheres gave way to gendered lives as distinct standards for men and for women and the gender binary became naturalized. In Art and Architecture, Alan Lessoff argues for a broad understanding of arts role in society. He emphasizes that the agendas pursued by artists and architects were distinct from questions of bourgeois uplift, especially institutional development, professionalism and professional status.  He also traces the creation of an American national art that would gain recognition internationally. Allan Lumba will round out the panel by placing the period into its proper global perspective in Empire, Expansion, and Its Consequences. Lumba examines the crucial significance of the GAPE in the historical analysis of U.S. empire. He reveals how a robust and varied historiography has critiqued the dominant narrative of American exceptionalism, then maps out new approaches to U.S. empire during the GAPE, specifically through global and transnational analyses of labor, finance, migration, and political organizing.Combined, the panelists and their topics provide a sense of the vibrant state of the field and underscore the importance and increasing relevance of this historical era. </p>","New Directions In The History Of The Gilded Age And Progressive Era"

Arguably more books have been written about the conflict than any other event in American history. But for all we have learned about every general and battle of the war, we know remarkably little about the war&quot;s veterans. Appomattox marked the end of the war, but not the end for the men who fought it. This panel, filled with diverse young scholars, seeks to point the way for new directions in studying Civil War veterans. Most of the recent scholarship on Civil War veterans has focused on trauma, and deservedly so. Eric T. Dean, Jr.&quot;s &quot;Shook Over Hell&quot; was a groundbreaking monograph that compared Civil War veterans with Vietnam veterans, and argued that veterans of the Civil War may have suffered with PTSD or something like it. Since its publication, a coterie of historians such as James Marten, R.B. Rosenburg, Patrick Kelley, and Rusty Williams have turned their attention to Soldiers Homes in the post-war North and South. David Silkenat and Diane Miller Sommerville have published research exploring the rising rate of suicide among Confederate veterans. Other scholars, among them Brian Craig Miller, Brian Matthew Jordan and Frances Clarke, have explored physical trauma and how amputees shaped post-war society, culture and the memory of the war. While these works are important and deserve mention, they ignore the inner lives of Civil War veterans. Using archives from around the country, and varying methodologies, the work on this panel explores the inner lives of Civil War veterans after the guns were silenced at Appomattox. Kathleen L. Thompson explores the Grand Army of the Republic as a coping mechanism for Civil War veterans in the postwar years. Katharine Dahlstrand, an East Tennessee native and combat veteran, attempts to understand the social network of Tennessee veterans in the postwar years. She combs through over 1,500 responses of Tennessee Civil War veterans to a questionnaire sent to them by state library archivists, and created GIS maps that document the critical moments of their lives. Finally, Dr. Dillon J. Carroll examines how veterans&quot; perceptions of mental illness was different than that of asylum physicians. Veterans tried to carve out a space of legitimacy to protect themselves and their comrades from the shame of mental illness. In contrast to asylum doctors, many Civil War veterans described mental illness among themselves, and other soldiers as a result of being &quot;broke down&quot; or &quot;played out&quot; a vague term that gave a sense of the multiple stressors of war. &quot;Played out&quot; was less clinical, and organically became popular among the soldiers. This would protect them from shame during the war, and help them win pensions after it. All of this work explores little known aspects of Civil War veterans, namely, what their communities were like after the war, how they coped with trauma, and how they perceived that trauma in new and different ways. </p>","New Directions In The History Of Veterans Of The American Civil War "

Diverse movements for anti-racism in America once faced similar challenges, certainly with the conservative ascendance that saw Richard Nixon elected in 1968 and again in 1972. Beyond the important but well-known movements and leaders of civil rights and black power activisms, however, anti-racist social movements also had a solid base in lesser studied institutions, organizations, and structures which gave anti-racism a foundation for growth across a broad cross-section of the population. This panel looks at various local examples of institutional anti-racism that worked to combat the rightward shift of American politics through the late 1960s and 1970s and suggests that the diversity of ideologies and modalities of such initiatives simultaneously revealed strengths. Using Chicago as a quintessential urban locale, this panel suggests that institutions as different from each other as government run war on poverty organizations which gave voice to issues of racism and sexism, progressive formations like Friendship House and the Catholic Interracial Council which combated the Cold War conservatism of the Catholic Church, and local Black Press businesses and institutions that gave voices to millions of black migrants from the South in a period of intense racism and reaction, are collective but understudied sites for anti-racist labors that allowed activists a diversity of channels to combat the rightward march in American politics into the 1970s. </p>","New Histories Of Anti-Racist Activism In Chicago"

But for many Americans, the search for both personal and cosmic meaning has been an extracurricular pursuit.  It has taken place in public spheres as well as private spaces, in mass movements as well as solitary reflection, in popular culture as well as so-called high art.  Exploring some of the many ways in which Americans have undertaken the quest for meaning in an increasingly rationalized, secular world, this roundtable-style panel brings together a range of subjects and stories that shed light on the rich archive of spiritual seeking in recent American history.   It shows how Americans of various backgrounds have sought to make the search for meaning into something more than just another academic subject—something more like a way of life. Our brief presentations address topics including, but not limited to: cosmic humanism, spiritual modernism, cinematic existentialism, and what we might call mass market deconstructionism.  The ultimate goal of the panel is to spark a conversation with the audience about some of the many ways in which we might begin to investigate the pursuit of meaning, spirituality, and transcendence in recent American history, and to show how philosophical, religious, and scientific ideas get turned into lived experiences.  At the intersection of contemplation and practice, the search for meaning complicates our common assumptions about what constitutes intellectual and cultural history.</p>","New Perspectives On Quests For Meaning In Twentieth-Century American Thought And Culture"

Unlike the case with many topics in economics, there is no consensus, even among those operating within the mainstream neoclassical paradigm, regarding the proper scope, terms, and limits of governmental economic and social regulation.    For example, we find proponents of economic and social regulation arguing their cases on very different grounds, e.g., to promote economic   stability, to bring about greater competition and/or equity, to protect consumers, to remedy market failure, etc.   And opponents of regulation?  They, too, base their opposition on a variety of grounds, ranging from governmental inefficiency to a desire to reduce transactions costs, and from the likelihood that regulators are subject to capture by the entities purportedly being regulated to  a belief that  there is no such thing as market failure at all.The lack of consensus becomes even more pronounced both when we go beyond neoclassical approaches and when we bring economists and historians together to interpret the role of regulation in American history.   Regarding disciplinary disagreements about the effects of regulation in our history:  Some economists and some historians  see regulation as a key source—and guarantor—of Americas economic strength.  On the other hand, others in both  disciplines  argue that America has long been over-regulated and/or that the countrys economic  performance historically would have been enhanced had we  relied more heavily  on private law—the common law, contracts, civil proceedings, and the like-- rather than on (often unelected) governmental administrators to mandate outcomes.In this roundtable we bring together four leading authorities on the history of governmental regulation in America, representing both history and economics, to discuss recent work on regulation and to share some of their current insights on the topic.  The regulatory interests (and perspectives)  of the participants are diverse—they have written extensively on governmental regulation of business, agriculture, media, food/health, and intellectual property among other topics—which will ensure that the discussion will be broad as well as deep.  In light of the profound changes in American politics of late—and, withal, aggressive challenges to the traditional role, even legitimacy of,   governmental regulation--this roundtable, sponsored by the Economic History Association, is as timely as it is important.</p>","New Perspectives On The History Of Regulation:  A Roundtable Discussion"

In this roundtable, four historians and public intellectuals – Lauren L. Anderson, Eileen Boris, Erik S. McDuffie, and Premilla Nadasen – will draw on their own work to engage new representations of transnational feminist history. Building on the recent transnational scholarship that has enlivened and enriched the field of U.S. womens and gender history, their conversation will underscore the complexity and breadth of twentieth-century transnational feminist history and its relevance today.They will reveal new representations of transnational feminist history in both content and form. In terms of content, Anderson, Boris, McDuffie, and Nadasen each trace transnational figures and movements that either challenge the primacy of Western, white, liberal feminism or that complicate this history by exploring how such feminist groups were embedded within imperial and racial political economies. Lauren L. Anderson examines the work of a number of black American women who promoted interracialism and internationalism in the interwar years. Eileen Boris reveals the close connections that both equal rights feminists and labor feminists had with U.S. empire from the 1930s through the 1950s when the ILO was revising labor instruments for colonial territories. She examines how equal rights versus protection for working women meant relatively little in colonial territories and mandates. Erik McDuffie will discuss the transnational activism of Midwestern black women in the Garvey movement from the 1920s through the 1970s, emphasizing both their importance to building the transnational Garvey movement and the paradoxes of their work. Above all, his remarks will speak to the underappreciated ideological complexities of twentieth-century black womens transnational activism.  Premilla Nadasen will draw on her activist work with the domestic workers alliance and her recent research on Miriam Makeba to think through the ways in which transnational feminism has been constructed and its utility for women of African descent.In terms of form, the panelists, all public intellectuals as well as historians, will discuss how new forms of transnational feminist history can reach broader audiences, particularly when in dialogue with contemporary activism and politics. Panelists will discuss the dialectical relationship between historical memory and political engagement today in the ILO, transnational worker activism, Black Lives Matter, and other contemporary activism, and through mediums such as op-eds, social media and blogs.The chair and moderator, Katherine Marino, will draw from her own work on Pan-American feminism, transnational anti-fascist feminism, and international human rights to frame the question of what it means to develop a critical and intersectional historiography of transnational feminism. She will also ask what importance transnational feminism has played in political and social movements in the U.S. historically and today. </p>","New Representations Of Transnational Feminist History"

As for those in the colonial period who spoke of the Golden Rule and the indivisibility of all who sprang from Adams seed, the less said the better because even those of their own religious community, mostly the Society of Friends, scorned, censored, and disowned them.   In recent years, however, the early abolitionists have earned some grudging respect.  Helped along by a revival of Quaker studies, the charge of fanaticism has been partially put at bay.  Yet the impact of these early antislavery stalwarts, who worked within a broad Atlantic setting and helped to create what is now regarded as the worlds first modern social movement, has barely reached the pages of high school and college textbooks and is almost entirely unknown to the general public.  New scholarship has the potential to change that situation.This roundtable discussion will consider recent work on the first wave of abolitionists before the American Revolution, almost all of them Quakers preaching universal love and the brotherhood of all mankind; and a second, overlapping wave who insisted that the new republic would not survive slavery&quot;s continuation without massive bloodshed and the scourging displeasure of a watching God.  As it happened, the early abolitionists – despite their small numbers and the repression they faced – contributed more to the abolitionism that emerged during and after the 1830s than we thought.The five members of the proposed roundtable, all specialists in the history of early abolitionism, will consider a broad range of issues.  Who were the early opponents of slavery and how did they arrive at their abolitionist positions?  What were their social backgrounds and experiences and how did these shape their antislavery ideas?  What variety of ideas did they express?  What tactics and strategy did they use to advance their cause?  What reception did they get and what impact did they have, in the short term and the long?  The participants will also discuss how early abolitionism played out in rural as opposed to urban settings, its characteristics before and after the American Revolution, and its successes and failures at local, state, national, and international levels.  They will conclude by asking, where might future scholarship on early abolitionism go?The participants in the roundtable are Jean R. Soderlund (Lehigh University), chair; Gary B.

Mrs. Nixon told me that you were great on the [Phil] Donahue Show. As you can imagine, she is an expert on politics and she predicts that whenever you decide to run for office you will be a winner! wrote Nixon to Trump in 1987. Each of the papers/presentations in this panel will focus on different cultural and political connections between Nixon and the Trump presidency. Nixons media and youth strategies, along with efforts to rehabilitate the disgraced Presidents legacy, have direct links to the political culture that led to a Trump presidency.Kathryn Brownells Richard Nixon and the Political Origins of the Information Age will examine Nixons war against the network broadcasting stations. Firmly believing that the media had kicked him around, Nixon stood determined to involve his administration in telecommunications policy-making, especially prioritizing efforts to undermine the influence of network television in American life. This paper will show how the concept of cable deregulation, and the roots of the modern Information age emerged not as a product of the Reagan or Clinton administrations. Rather, these policies originated in the Nixon administration as he embraced the concept of media diversity to weaken the influence of the major networks that he felt had undemocratically influenced American political discussions. Seth Blumenthals paper Changing Perspectives of Young Voters since 1972 looks at Nixons efforts to gather support from non-college youth. Before baby boomers, the terms college and non-college voter received scant attention. By 1972, Nixons re-election campaign set out to counter his anti-war opponent, Senator George McGovern, who had built an insurgent campaign that attracted many campus liberals. Thus, Nixons Young Voters for the President organizers intended to maximize the presidents vote among the segment of new voters who have not attended college and who are employed. Utilizing popular imagery from film, television and political ads, this paper discusses young voters shifting significance in the changing realignment narratives from 1972 to the present. Michael Koncewiczs The Ongoing Effort to Rehabilitate Richard Nixon will cover recent attempts to by Nixon loyalists, scholars and journalists to rescue the 37th Presidents legacy. In 2016, the Nixon Library renovated its museum galleries for the first time since the Librarys opening. With the exception of the Librarys nonpartisan Watergate Gallery which was completed in 2011, the Librarys new exhibits continued to adopt a defensive tone that sought to build on recent conciliatory depictions of the controversial President. This paper will not only analyze the Nixon Library, but will instead try to place it alongside other forms of Nixon revisionism that can be seen in both Nixon scholarship and popular culture. The panel will encourage audience participation throughout each of the presentations and will rely on using audio (Nixon tapes) and videos (recent depictions of Nixon) in order to expand on the conferences theme of The Forms of History. </p>","Nixon In The Age Of Trump: How The 37Th President Shapes Todays Political Culture"

Their rate of workforce participation jumped nearly nine percentage points in the 1970s alone – twelve million more women were in the labor force by the end of the decade than at its beginning. The majority of women pouring into the workforce worked in the service, retail and financial sectors – sectors that formed the core of a neoliberal financialized capitalism.  Contemporaries and scholars alike have celebrated womens new opportunities in the workplace during the late twentieth century. But the struggle remained incomplete.  Women, including many mothers of young children, began to participate at the center of a transforming economy without a new family-friendly paradigm such as flexible schedules.  Few working-class women were presented with opportunities to earn the &quot;family wage&quot; that had been the ideal province of the male wage earner. Finally, women&quot;s new roles as workers too often threatened to reinforce racial hierarchies. It seemed that women&quot;s workforce participation met the needs of globalizing corporations at the expense of working people.Many contested the neoliberal degradation of labor standards and fought collectively for fair wages, flexible schedules and robust social benefits.  This session explores mechanisms women employed to gain power within a transformative capitalism, including labor and civil rights organizations. Traci Parker considers black womens efforts to eliminate race and gender discrimination in hiring and promotion at Sears, Roebuck, and Company in the post-Civil Rights Movement era in African American Women and the Sears, Roebuck, and Company Affirmative Action Cases. Lane Windham, in a paper entitled &quot;Rosa the Retailer: Women, Unions and Resistance in the Retail Workforce,&quot; explores how sales clerks, cashiers and distribution center workers in the 1970s and 1980s tried to organize new unions and use their union contracts to resist the low-road employment policies that mark the retail workers&quot; experience today.

World War II defines Americans understandings of these locales, from brutal Pacific battles to tangible post-war reminders of U.S. victory and military power.  These places were sites of war and conflict, and their histories entangled international and local politics from across the Pacific that endured far after the fighting was over. Laborers, sex workers, and refugees moved in between Japan, the Philippines, Okinawa, and the Bonin Islands, and their experiences, and governments attempts to control their movement demonstrate the contours and conflicts between the United States and Japan in the post-war era. In the first paper, Sho Masaki analyzes the removal, and then repatriation of some, but not all, of the residents of the Bonin Islands.  In the second paper, Taihei Okada focuses on comfort women or sex workers under both the Japanese imperial system and under U.S. occupation, and he argues how the control of sex workers defined both regimes. Finally, Colleen Woods turns to the workers who built the U.S. military bases in Okinawa, examining the labor history of Filipino and Okinawans. Collectively, these papers demonstrate the vast number circuits that developed in the post-war era, and the precarious nature of work and resettlement in the early Cold War.

While the last decade witnessed a new attention among historians to the role the state has played in fueling financialization and the impact of financialization on government, there has been scant attention to the role of non-profits and foundations in those processes. This panel aims to correct that oversight by examining the role of non-profit organizations in adopting and promoting the expansion of market-based solutions and ideas, particularly as a solution to social inequality. It will also explore the relationship of these institutions to the American government against the changing political and economic landscape of the last decades of the twentieth century.  The three papers explore these larger questions from different and distinct vantage points. First, Lila Bermans paper explores how massive transformations in philanthropic practice and rhetoric enabled the expansion of market logic into new spheres of American life by looking at the efforts of American Jewish philanthropists to make capital aggregation into an acceptable and wise charitable strategy. She suggests that this approach did not change American Jewish philanthropy, but contributed to the wider belief that American progress best occurred through the growth of free markets. Claire Dunning similarly examines the ways in which an existing non-profit model helped to fuel financialization. However, in this case, she will examine community development corporations and the role of non-profit finance intermediaries in affordable housing development. By looking at several Boston-area efforts to improve neighborhoods, she argues that the rise of financial language and tools in the social sector emerged as much from grassroots activists needing access to capital as it did from elites seeking to deploy their wealth for charitable purposes. Finally, Lily Geismer takes up these issues from the perspective of the state. She looks at Bill Clintons programs to promote private sector investment and access to loans and capital as a means to address poverty and inequality in distressed communities both as president and at his foundation. Probing Clintons commitment to idea of the doing well by doing good, Geismer will examine the development of a Democratic and liberal version of neoliberalism, and the role of foundations in fostering it, which has come to shape many of the prevailing ideas about markets and private investment as a tool to address to poverty and social inequality. Jonathan Levys recent work on non-profit corporations, for-profit corporations, and the fiscal state across the twentieth century will inform his comments on the three papers. By placing these topics and issues in conversation, our intent is to reveal the complexity and spectrum of market-thinking and policy, particularly among those identifying as liberals or Democrats, and to better understand the new and dominant place that foundations and non-profits from have come to play in the development of public policy and the financialization of everyday life. </p>","Philanthrocapitalism:  Foundations And The Turn To Market-Based Solutions For Inequality Since The 1970s"

This roundtable turns to childrens museums as alternative sites of historical engagement where children can travel back in time through play. From interactive exhibits on local immigration history to hands-on activities that introduce historical methods, childrens museums enable their young visitors to learn not only about various historical moments but also witness the investigative work necessary for researching and disseminating history. Through play, children can place themselves within the narratives they encounter. Childrens museums thus offer a useful window into the ways that play shapes how various histories are told and how children then understand these histories.  Of particular importance are the ways that childrens museums present the histories of people in the margins. This roundtable therefore also addresses the age-specific, play-based activities and programming that introduce race, gender, and other intersectional identities through a historical lens and consequently encourage broader conversations about difference and belonging that can continue beyond the museum. Understanding these spaces as both sites of innocent play and as extensions of the classroom, it additionally invites conversation about museums and pedagogy more broadly. As Kristina DuRocher, Rebecca de Schweinitz, and other scholars have argued, age is an important analytic for understanding how various racialized and gendered political projects have unfolded throughout American history. However, as this roundtable contends, age is also critical when considering how this nations past is now disseminated to and consumed by various publics. This roundtable brings together academics and museum professionals who have either designed programming for children in museums or researched and taught on historical engagement inside museums. As the Associate Director of School Programs at the New-York Historical Society, Allyson Schettino discusses the institutions childrens history museum and its unique approach for engaging students with the past: teaching history through the eyes of young historical figures. Working within education departments at museums, Krystal Gladden and Stephanie Cunningham both broaden the discussion by considering the pedagogical tools that museums not specifically for children can nevertheless use to teach students history, particular histories of people of color. Tiffney Laings creation of History Makers and other educational toys about African American history, however, illustrates how conversations about histories of marginalized communities can continue beyond the museum. The final two panelists sit on the academic side of the table. Currently researching how people engage with race in exhibitionary settings, Anni Pullagura addresses the affective labor that children perform when encountering forms of difference in museums. And having taught a course on the history of race and childhood, Felicia Bevel considers how age is an important category of historical analysis within museums, classrooms, and other sites of learning. Together, these six panelists explore how play, both within and beyond childrens museums, helps children engage with the past.</p>","Playing With The Past: Childrens Museums As Alternative Sites Of Historical Engagement"

In order to stimulate conversation about the unique ability of podcasting to expand disciplinary approaches to the past and more widely disseminate historians ideas, this session will bring together six scholars whose podcasts take different forms, reach diverse public audiences, and have varied purposes.The participants podcasts reflect the medium&quot;s capacious possibilities.  Since 2011, Adam Smith has partnered with the BBC to broadcast historically informed programming with high production values designed to explain American history to his predominantly British audience.  Liz Covarts Ben Franklin&quot;s World features weekly interviews with historians who discuss their work on early American history and how historians practice history.  Remarkably, she has developed a business model around engaging conversations about historical scholarship.  Nicole Hemmer&quot;s weekly podcast Past Present engages with contemporary politics and culture by focusing on breaking news and timely stories.  In each episode, she moderates a discussion with fellow historians Natalia Petrzela and Neil Young, whose disparate interests, expertise, and personalities spur an entertaining exchange of views that bring historical antecedents to the fore.  Similarly, Ed O&quot;Donnell&quot;s In The Past Lane seeks to explain &quot;why things are the way they are&quot; in a thought-provoking but entertaining way.  The podcast features interviews with historians, history thinkpieces, and analyses of portrayals of history in popular culture, such as the TV series Mercy Street.  Julie Golia&quot;s Flatbush + Main is a monthly podcast from Brooklyn Historical Society. With co-host Zaheer Ali, Julie interviews scholars and analyzes oral histories and archival sources to unearth local histories with national resonance.  In 2017, Graham Peck will work with Saint Xavier University&quot;s students and radio station to create podcasts on the life of Catherine McAuley, founder of the Sisters of Mercy, to illuminate and promote the charism that lies at the heart of the university&quot;s mission.Despite its challenges, podcasting enables historians to reimagine the discipline.  Its relatively low start-up costs reduce barriers to entry and enable historians to forge direct connections with listeners.  The medium encourages experimentation with format.  Most podcasts have multiple hosts, guests, segments, and subject matter. Podcasts also encourage creative use of evidence.  Podcasts leverage the expertise of guests and hosts to distill complex problems or unknown pasts into engaging stories and analysis.  Their use of music and recordings creates immersive listener experiences that appeal to broad audiences.  And, most importantly, podcasts create intimate connections between historians and individual listeners, relationships historians can leverage through the power of websites and social media.  Although there are real challenges in creating successful podcasts--finding time to research, record, and edit them, acquiring and maintaining an audience, tracking and analyzing the audience, and balancing podcasting with other professional demands--podcasts are still uniquely suited to reaching new public audiences interested in history, a goal of great import for all historians.</p>","Podcasting: History's Future In The Digital Age?"

Throughout North America, policing strategies and the technologies used by law enforcement have proved critical in shaping settler colonial efforts to discipline bodies and cement national formation. Colonial policing, to borrow from John Brewer, naturalized both martial and psychological programs of policing that were designed to order settler societies along racial, class, and gender lines. The issues associated with law enforcement and settler societies continue to impact the lives of Indigenous people, the poor and working class, migrant communities, and people of African descent. The recent spate of violent encounters between police officers and African Americans and Latino/as in the United States suggest that the violent legacy of law enforcement is far from a relic of the past; it is instead a lived reality. This roundtable builds on historical analyses of law enforcement and settler societies in North American contexts. The participants aim to present fresh insights into a range of topics associated with settler colonial law enforcement – such as the use of violence in policing, technologies of power, and the impact of gender and sexuality on colonial policing practices – to advance our understanding of law enforcement in settler colonial contexts throughout North America.</p>","Policing Settler Colonies: Life And Death In North America"

When we interpret the American past, we use geography to provide physical, metaphorical, and visual links between bygone eras and the present. Historians, operating as teachers, scholars, and public intellectuals, work with maps and the broader landscape of geography in order to connect the physical spaces in which we reside with the political meaning they obtain. Museums, archives, and classrooms are pedagogical geographies in which we work every day, yet they themselves are apart of a wider world of information, cartographic technology, and intelletcual representation. Further, what role do regions play in the formation of Anglo-American colonization and nation-building? Teachers and researchers have long identified the traditional regional format—with New England, the middle colonies, and the South—but how did these ideas of sectional allegiance shift over time? How did people conceive and challenge modes of geopolitical belonging in the face of historical change? Our panel reevaluates the role of maps and regions as complex historical forms that made and unmade empires in the early Atlantic World.   To begin, Nicholas Gliserman shows that the 1680s were a period of boundary making and contestation in northeastern America, as imperial officials sought to embed cartographic practices within a total reorganization of empire. But how did this project play out in real time, on the ground? Gliserman argues that scholars have overstated the initial success of imperial reforms, and that the archival organization of cartographic (and textual) materials has played a key role in what we think we know about the era. Next, Nora Slonimsky reappraises the relationship between geography, representation, and state-building through the work of colonial cartographer Lewis Evans, who produced one of the most popular and pirated maps of North America in 1755. His General Map was a mosaic of representation; depicting indigenous sovereignty as well as settler advancements, Evans sketched out the political and commercial realities of life in British North America. As Slonimsky argues, Evans also exerted his sovereignty over the cartographic text by exeercising the claim of copyright. In this first entanglement of law, politics, and commerce, nearly thirty years before the current scholarship dates the start of intellectual property in America, representation and labor came to the forefront of imperial border disputes that would linger into the early republic. Finally, moving out from the archive and the raw construction of its contents, Benjamin Park looks at the intelletcual inequalities embedded in geographic representation. During the first two decades of the 19th century, for example, the significance of regional identities blossomed during national political debates over slavery . Divisive questions about the regionaliztion of slavery, as Park demonstrates, animated white elites, radical evangelicals, and free blacks; their answers held major implications for the formation and growth of young America.</p>","Political Geographies Of Representation: Regions, Boundaries, And Property In Early America"

Each panelist explores varied responses to racial inequality on the local, state, and national levels. The papers each highlight myriad responses to the climate of Cold War repression, focusing especially on how race and ethnicity influenced political action. As the so-called Cold War consensus unraveled, the day-to-day resistance strategies of activists shifted to challenge the the United States claims as a champion of democracy and the leader of the free world. The connecting thread between the panelists is their focus on people who risked political imprisonment for the circulation of radical speech, ideas, and action. Domestic responses to the rise of Third World liberation movements also appear in these presentations, as they fostered inventive and distinctive collaborations across racial, national, and gendered boundaries. Another thread linking these papers is an analysis of how activists crafted strategies to defy state authority and surveillance. Subject to increased state scrutiny at the height of the Cold War, these groups still challenged the normal operation of the state.</p>","Race, Radicalism, And Reaction In The 1960s And 1970s"

Despite the increased interest in right-wing politics, radical conservatism remains an underrepresented facet of political history. This panel uses far-right activists as a medium to understand the broader history of conservatism in the twentieth century. To illuminate the influence of the Radical Right, this panel focuses on three time periods and subjects: anti-Semitism within the anti-New Deal conservative coalition; the fight to repeal taxation, particularly the Sixteenth Amendment, during the 1960s; and the complicated relationship between conservatism and right-wing populism in the late twentieth century. Utilizing archival resources, newspapers, and periodicals, these three papers argue that far-right conservatism helped shape modern politics through populist rhetoric and grassroots activism, notably by reducing the political spectrum to a communist-or-conservative binary and using conspiracy theories to push the American polity rightward. These papers illustrate that reactionary conservatives were not simply anxiety-addled eccentrics; rather, ultraconservatives pursued platforms and forged political connections in an attempt to establish their idealized vision for the United States. This panel highlights the strands of ultraconservatism that permeated twentieth century right-wing politics, including anti-Semitism, fiscal reactionism, anti-statism, and anti-elite populism. Ultimately, the far-right created complex webs of local, regional, and national activism, delineated the divisions within contemporary conservatism, and helped shape the contours of the modern conservative movement.</p>","Radicalism On The Right: Ultraconservative Activism In The Twentieth Century"

It offers new perspectives, examining school site selection as a tool of segregationists and exploring the larger constellation of ideas from which local segregationists drew.Karen Benjamin analyzes an overlooked method that city planners and other elites used to achieve residential segregation in southern cities:  school site selection.  Since many young families seek to live near the schools that their children will attend, locating schools for black and white children in not just separate neighborhoods but in racially isolated locations has proven effective in deepening racial separation.  Benjamin calls upon historians to consider school site selection as one of the most effective tools to impose residential segregation, especially once the courts declared racial zoning to be unconstitutional.  Elizabeth Herbin-Triant places the story of local residential segregation campaigns in one state in a larger context, showing how the particular situation of middling whites in North Carolina came together with inspiration from other southern states and other countries to propel forward an effort to separate the residences of black and white people in the state.  Recent work (such as Carl Nightingales Segregation: A Global History of Divided Cities and Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynoldss Drawing the Global Colour Line: White Mens Countries and the International Challenge of Racial Equality) argues that there was an international exchange of segregationist ideas.  Herbin-Triant is interested in where middling whites, the group behind residential segregation in North Carolina, fit into this exchange.  She explores the question of to what extent campaigns for residential segregation were meant to benefit elite whites, and to what extent they were meant to benefit middling whites.</p>","Reconsidering Residential Segregation In The South Through School Site Selection, Class, And A Transatlantic Exchange Of Ideas"

The purpose of the Project was to collect Chicana/o Movement activists/participants oral histories about their involvement and contributions in the Mexican American civil rights movement in Sacramento from the years of 1965 through 1980. The group felt a tremendous responsibility of recording the lived histories of this aging population and make known their efforts, dreams, and struggles as they lived and remembered them. The Project was successful in collecting 100 richly detailed and textured oral histories. However, the content of the oral histories is not the focus of the conference panel. Rather, the focus is on the process through which the Project committee gathered the oral histories. The process was very involved and required tremendous time and organizing from the Project steering committee. The interviewees were selected/identified by Project committee members and also through recommendations and referrals from the Sacramento Chicano Movement co-hort. All interviewees signed a consent form which granted permission for the Project to release their audio-video recordings to the Sacramento State University Archives. The interviewers were for the most part undergraduate students who were enrolled in my Qualitative Methods courses, which I currently teach in the Department of Chicana/o Studies at the University of California at Davis. Teaching in Chicana/o Studies facilitated the production of the oral histories because the department strongly supports faculty who work closely in the community. All oral histories were audio-video recorder, edited, and will be submitted in the near future to the Sacramento State University Archives and made available to the general public and researchers interested in understanding Chicana/o Movement experiences.To provide the audience with an understanding of how the process unfolded, the first speaker, Senón Valádez, will address how his idea to document the oral histories of the Chicana/o Movement in Sacramento came about and how he put together the steering committee.

Recent work by historians of law, politics, gender, slavery, race, and capitalism have not only brought the state back in to American history, but recast our understanding of the states history and its role in society. What, then, does the burgeoning field of digital history contribute to this new body of literature? Some historians complain that digital history is too infatuated with flashy bells and whistles and has failed to make substantive scholarly interventions. This panel aims to change that by bringing together four historians who are using digital mapping to reinterpret American state power in the long nineteenth century. Each of the panelists will present very brief (5-10 minute) introductions of their projects. Rather than showcasing the digital tools themselves, they will concentrate on the major research findings and scholarly arguments that those new methods have allowed them to make. Their overviews will serve as a concrete starting point for the heart of the session: a conversation amongst the panelists, co-chairs, and audience members on broader topics such as the rapidly changing historiography of the American state, theories about space and geography, and the role of analysis and interpretation in the practice of digital history. Nicole Phelps begins by tracing the history of the US Consular Service between 1789 and 1924. Historians have traditionally seen the work of the consular service through its role in expanding trade. While important, consuls did much more. Charting the rapid spatial growth of the US Consular Service reveals the countrys shifting global interests, the expanding mandate of the service, and the way its growth forced US citizens and foreigners to confront US sovereignty abroad. Next, Benjamin Hoy charts the growth of federal infrastructure in both Canada and the United States between 1860 and 1930. He uses GIS software to show where people were hired and fired, where posts were built or fell into disrepair, and what incidences received federal attention and which did not. This analysis shows a highly uneven process, encompassing a vast range of capacities and approaches to deploying state power on both sides of the border.Jamie Pietruska uses digital mapping to recover a large-scale network of weather-reporting stations in the United States in the nineteenth century. This network has traditionally been seen as the product of government efforts that appeared in the wake of the U.S. Civil War. Instead, Pietruska uses datasets compiled by historical climatologists to reveal a longer and much more dynamic spatio-historical trajectory, one in which overlapping information networks both competed and collaborated with state initiatives. Finally, Cameron Blevins focuses on the single largest arm of the federal government: the U.S. Post. Mapping this massive network debunks any lingering notions of a weak or limited nineteenth-century state.

Recent historical scholarship demonstrates that slavery was not just a southern institution but a national one, both economically and politically. Many historians have taken issue with Eugene Genoveses formulation of a pre-capitalist slave South and instead argued that slavery was intensely capitalist and inseparable from northern agriculture, manufacturing, and finance. This panel further complicates the dichotomy between a slave South and a free North by focusing on multidirectional interactions in the Midwest, broadly defined to include the Ohio Valley South. For slaveholders and enslaved people in the early republican Ohio Valley, Cumberland Presbyterians in the antebellum lower North and upper South, and prisoners in Civil War–era Kentucky, the Ohio River was not a hard boundary between slavery and freedom, if indeed it was a boundary at all. The various flows of people, goods, and ideas in this mid-continental region—catalyzed by the confluence of Native Americans, Euro-Americans, and African-Americans—tied the two sides of the Ohio River together at the same time that other forces were dividing them. This panel joins Christopher Phillips, Edward L. Ayers, Bridget Ford, and others in their effort to examine the lives of people in this middle border region, and what the construction of a distinct North and South looked like on the ground in all its messiness.</p>","Reinterpreting North And South In The Midwest"

But not all would-be migrants had the freedom of movement to leave their home states. In the historiography, the march towards restriction in the early-mid twentieth century is typically framed from the U.S. perspective, ignoring foreign governments efforts to police and restrict emigration before the war. How did European states, empires, and colonies -- in our case studies Italy, Austria-Hungary, and Malta -- view and attempt to intervene in the complex political, social, and economic forces driving attitudes and legislation about transatlantic migration? How did the restrictions that the sending countries put in place affect migrants experiences? How did U.S. and European governmental restrictions respond to one another? This panel explores the role that European governments of sending countries played in the rise of a global regime of migration restriction, bring together migration history with foreign relations. European restrictions constricted who could migrate, for how long, under what circumstances, and what kind of relationship they could have with their home state and individuals there after leaving. By focusing on restriction from sending countries and responses to European restrictions, this panel frames migration restriction to the U.S. as a transnational phenomenon and emphasizes that restriction emerged as a feature of governmental responses well before the passage of the 1924 Johnson-Reed Immigration Act, and that European governments continued to legislate emigration after U.S. laws were put in place. </p>","Rethinking Migration Restriction: Sending State Activism In The Era Of Mass Transatlantic Migration"

Harvey, whose promising dissertation explores the origins of the U.S./Mexico borderlands maquiladoras and the emergence of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the latter half of the twentieth century.  Mr. Harveys paper will be in conversation with the works of two early-career historians that place race and labor at the center of the study of 19th and 20th c. U.S. political economy.  Together, these three papers examine the ways in which U.S. And non-U.S. state actors and corporate elites worked to establish and consolidate territorial claims in disputed lands/borderlands and regulate and control natural resources and labor migration.  As these three papers will discuss, what often appears as inevitable U.S. capitalist expansion and development resulted from a wide range of collaborations and contestations on the part of state actors, corporate leaders, labor leaders, migrants and indigenous inhabitants. Each of the papers in this session explores a different case of U.S. capitalist development and borderlands control as co-constitutive across the 19th and early 20th century.  Sean Harveys  A Clutch for Bilingual Bureaucrats: Runaway Plants and the Rise and Fall of the Commission for Border Development and Friendship, 1966-1972 looks at the role of labor unions and Republicans in Congress in shaping border economic development in their effort to protect the exportation of American jobs.

Upon receiving a graduate degree in history, many advanced degree holders want to revise their graduate work for publication or pursue new historical projects but find this task daunting without institutional support. This session seeks to reach a broad audience among the historical community by addressing how to maintain an active scholarly publishing record while working outside of academia. The format will offer a combined roundtable-workshop: panelists will discuss their experiences and share relevant, practical advice for 30 minutes, followed by a 30-minute hands-on workshop and strategizing session where participants will develop individual action plans. The session will conclude with a 30-minute group discussion and Q&A. The panelists and commentator all received their doctorate degrees in U.S. History or a related field and have pursued successful careers as tenure-track and contingent faculty, K-12 educators, and state and local government employees as well as serving as volunteers, activists, and practicing historians.

Scandal has been an important part of popular culture, and Haggard is not alone in labeling and remembering certain historical phenomena in terms of scandal. How does scandal operate as a form of history? This panel will probe this question by examining four case studies of scandalous episodes from the Gilded Age and beyond. With a combined interest in how questions of race, religion, gender, and sexuality played out in the popular press and culture, the panelists will explore how Americans fascination with scandal led to new articulations of proper religiosity, morality, sexuality, and gender expression.Carolee Klimchocks study of elite women eloping with their coach drivers argues that, although always sensational, these stories would eventually become sanctioned and even romanticized in some newspaper articles. Unlike their more conservative counterparts that valued traditional morality, this new class of reporters emphasized the romantic nature of elopement scandals. Occasionally, they even turned a blind eye on the interracial nature of elopement scandals, decades before interracial marriage became legal. Suzanna Krivulskaya will present the surprisingly widespread phenomenon of ministerial elopements which reached its peak in the 1890s. The paper will focus on the roots of how both the self-proclaimed secular press and, increasingly, the mainstream media used these scandalous episodes to question and undermine traditional religious authority in places across the United States. Rachel McBride Lindseys paper will move the panel into the early twentieth century and consider the scandalous religious career of Josie K. Folsom, a midwestern Spiritualist leader and religious entrepreneur. Amid accusations of fraud and forgery of spiritual writings, Folsoms career highlights the important yet often overlooked material and visual aspects of the study of religion, morality, and authenticity. Finally, Kati Curts will present a religious history of Elizabeth (Baby Doe) Tabor, whose sensational rags-to-riches-and-back-to-rags life story played out not only in newspapers, but also in Hollywood film and Cold War era opera. Focusing on Baby Does later reclusive life in a Colorado shack and analyzing her materiality, Curts looks at the scandals surrounding the unusual career of Tabor and highlights the profound importance of scandal for the study of religion and American frontier history. In addition to the traditional paper format, several panelists will also present a digital history component of their projects. The panels chair and commentator, Bobby Smiley, a digital history librarian, will then address the challenges and opportunities for the changing forms in which historians study and present their projects in the digital age.</p>","Romance, Reverends, And Renegades: Scandal As Gilded Age History"

Specifically, early-nationalists view it as a story of change—the culmination of a long incremental process through which shared circumstances in America produced common cultural traits in colonists and increasingly differentiated and alienated them from their compatriots and government across the Atlantic.  Scholarship on colonial America, by contrast, is generally more skeptical regarding Americanization and the cultural divide between provincials and Britons.  This panel examines how scholarly research shapes public understanding of the Revolution.  A survey of representative undergraduate syllabi, leading textbooks, and popular histories reveals that the common periodization of the Revolution reflects the dominance of early-nationalists in framing Revolutionary pedagogy.  Ending the Revolutionary era in 1789, with the founding of a new nation-state, conditions students to see emergent nationhood as the key storyline in the coming of the Revolution.  It frames a narrative of gradual cultural change during the colonial era, driven by uniquely American circumstances like slavery, economic and demographic dynamism, ethnic tensions, and other effects of expanding frontiers.  By contrast, a large body of colonial scholarship offers an alternate understanding of the ends—and end point—of the Revolution.  It challenges the idea of the colonies centrifugal trajectory, traces forces of Anglicization in America, sets the Revolution in the context of English culture, and presents it as a product of cultural change taking place in England, rather than America.   Scholars of Indigenous America see a different periodization altogether, one that does not hinge on the Revolution, but traces a continuous history of conquest, accommodation, and change that created an Anglo and Native America.  While scholars have benefited from this lively debate on the origins, meaning, and ends of the Revolution, students and laypeople are largely unaware of it.  To allow maximal time for audience participation, this panel comprises three panelists—an eastern-seaboard colonialist (Chet), an expanding-frontier early-nationalist (Hyde), and a specialist on Europes Age of Revolution (Lerner).   It is chaired by a preeminent scholar of the American Revolution (Countryman).   Panelists will discuss how their vantage points on the Revolution—from America and Europe, from the West and the East, from the nineteenth century and the seventeenth century—frame their classroom narratives on the Revolution, and how receptive or resistant students are to these narratives.   Since many in the audience will be as experienced as the panelists in teaching Revolutionary history, the panel presentations (10-12 minutes each) will initiate an open-forum discussion, instead of a traditional Q&A session directed at the panelists.   Instructors in the audience will be invited to relate how a professors research agenda can enforce a particular classroom narrative on students, whether students are aware of this, and whether professors enlighten or confuse undergraduates by trying to address this by presenting the Revolution from multiple perspectives in a single class.  Given that scholars cannot accommodate conflicting conceptual frameworks in their research monographs, can they achieve such intellectual pluralism in an undergraduate classroom?</p>","Scholars As Instructors:  The Impact Of Research Agendas On The Teaching Of The American Revolution"

Some historians have made extensive use of oral history as the basis of their scholarship on sexuality, particularly in lesbian, gay, and trans history (including Elizabeth Kennedy and Madeleine Davis; Nan Alamilla Boyd; Horacio Roque Ramirez; Marcia Gallo; Daniel Rivers). Indeed, queer historians have often had to employ oral history to uncover sexualities that had once been officially suppressed, and they have already done a good deal of theorizing about sexuality and oral history. Whether subjects identify as queer, straight, gender non-conforming, or asexual, historians may encounter both silences and revelations in oral history interviews. Like the lacunae and crossed out passages in letters and diaries, sexual silences in oral histories can be as revealing as what has been recorded, if we read their meanings carefully. This session builds on the theories of oral historians who have written about reticence and silence, and the memories behind them, to explore some of the spaces that fall between silence and speech in interviews, particularly those related to sexuality. The papers explore the terrain of what might be called unrevealable revelations,&quot; an approach that speaks to the conference focus on forms of representation by asking how scholars can or should represent what they are discouraged from telling. The papers will also address the limits of oral history for probing communities in transition and displacement and effects of public policy on shaping our access to historical memory. Panelists will explore both the private side of knowledge – in particular, womens sexual secrets and revelations – and the silences engendered by the public/policy side of sexual history, in which queer oral history has played a critical role.</p>","Sexuality And Oral History: The Challenges Of Public And Private Knowledge "

The technological and social trajectory of our project is a living laboratory demonstrating a variety of contemporary forms in which history is made. We host a unique online archive at Foundsf.org which consists of almost 1,800 webpages containing thousands of historic photos, hundreds of video clips from oral histories weve conducted, as well as dozens of historic film clips gleaned from the Prelinger Archive and ever-expanding YouTube collections. We collect and archive primary sources along with excerpts from books and original essays, thereby doing double duty as both a repository of historical materials for future historians as well as an interpretive site for understanding how the many threads of history have brought us to this juncture. In addition to this extensive work of organizing and maintaining our online archive we also produce two seasons annually of Public Talks that are themselves sites of history production. We record and archive our Talks as podcasts. We also host two seasons of walking and bicycle tours each year, taking anywhere from one to several dozen people on curated walks or bike rides through the City to peel back the layers of history in situ. After over two decades of this work we are in partnership with academic programs at Stanford, UC Berkeley, the University of San Francisco, and a dozen local history groups in addition to the San Francisco Public Library and the California Historical Society. Weve also published three anthologies of essays on local history with City Lights Books, the last of which, Ten Years That Shook the City: San Francisco 1968-78 won the California Book Award for contribution to publishing in 2011. At the annual OAH conference in 2018 to be held in Sacramento we propose to host a workshop that demonstrates the multifaceted work weve been doing, and then to convene a critical discussion that would challenge the limits of the effort. Some of the questions we hope to discuss are:1. The role of amateur history production vs. that done by professionals.2. Journalism as the first draft of history—mainstream newspapers and neighborhood newspapers3. Objectivity and neutrality in history production: false goals?4. Browsing as narration, and the loss of coherence.5. If multiple points of view, multiple voices are the proper way to frame historical information is there a role for the Grand Narrative?6.

Scholars have recently studied numerous aspects of how slaves worked with livestock, as fishermen, or against animals meant to track their very movements. As well, slaves were burdened by living as livestock, often infested with living microbes, vermin, and pests that could both harm and entertain. Slaves found much relevance for these encounters with animals in trickster tales, for labor as cowboys, and even as friendly companions. Many slaves wrote of their experiences with animals throughout the Atlantic World. Often, slaves discussed running from hounds while using their knowledge of the environment to escape the skillful noses of their masters dogs. Many slaves were also burdened through working with agricultural animals in their daily lives. Other slaves found in animals an ephemeral, ritual, and symbolic space to come to terms with the horror of laboring in their masters fields. Animals, and African knowledge about the specific powers of animals within spiritual traditions, often provided forms of psychosomatic resistance to the masters goals of social death. Throughout the Atlantic World, the relationship between animals and slaves created methods for masters to assert their power, as made famous in scenes from the recent film Django Unchained (2012). However, slaves also formulated spaces for resistance in the transgressive particular spaces that animals inhabited. This dialectic, between the power of masters to create bio-political weapons out of animals and the agency of slaves to resist that power through their own beliefs in different animals inherent innocence and transgression, offers a new lens for analyzing the continuum of slave experience in the early modern Atlantic World. </p>","Slavery, Animals, And Environmental Agency In The Atlantic World"

The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC, was founded in 1960 when legendary organizer Ella Baker brought together sit-in leaders from across the South. The only national civil rights organization led by young people, SNCC activists became full-time organizers, working with community leaders to build grassroots organizations in the Deep South. SNCC focused on voter registration and on mounting a systemic challenge to the white supremacy entrenched in the country&quot;s political, economic, and social structures.While scholars have written a number of important books exploring and illustrating the significance of SNCC, the general public tends to know very little about the movement beyond Dr. King and a few high profile demonstrations. Even the attention that has accompanied the series of 50th anniversaries of movement milestones has tended to reinforce a top-down and &quot;Big Events&quot; focus. As the movement&quot;s victories are facing serious challenges and as young people across the country have renewed interest in direct action, organizing, and challenging ingrained power, it is essential that a fuller, richer accounting of SNCC&quot;s history reach the wider public, especially students, activists, and today&quot;s version of the &quot;ordinary people&quot; who were at the heart of the Civil Rights Movement.The SNCC Digital Gateway, which had a soft-launch on December 13, 2016, is designed to meet this need. Using documentary footage, audio recordings, photographs, and documents, the site portrays how SNCC organizers, alongside thousands of local Black residents, worked so that Black people could take control of their lives. It unveils the inner workings of SNCC as an organization, examining how it coordinated sit-ins and freedom schools, voter registration and economic cooperatives, anti-draft protests and international solidarity struggles. The website includes a wide range of historic materials (hosted in digital collections at repositories around the country); over 150 individual profiles;  more than 100 events pages; Inside SNCC pages that explore how the organization worked; an Our Voices section, which presents aspects of SNCC&quot;s history from the eyes of the activists themselves; and a Map, which connects users to the people who worked--and the events that happened--in specific places. The project team is currently identifying and developing materials that are especially germane today, and exploring relevant and accessible formats for sharing it.Our panel will include four people from the editorial board--SNCC veterans Judy Richardson and Charles Cobb, Jr., and scholars Hasan Kwame Jeffries and Emilye Crosby--reflecting on the project and resulting website. After a brief introduction to the website, the panelists will discuss how the project and website content was developed; plans for using the site to engage teachers, students, activists, and others (as well as initial experiences); and their hopes for how the website and its content will inform future generations.

This panel argues for going beyond the use of material culture by incorporating hands-on experience into teaching and as a component of our research. In practice, this involves developing knowledge, skills and values from direct experiences outside a traditional academic setting. The three panelists discuss the various ways in which their research and teaching has pursued this emerging academic pathway. Nancy Shoemakers broad-based approach discusses how her research depends on understanding how soap was made and its implications for those people who engaged in the process. She discusses the three kinds of experiential research employed in her work: fieldwork to fields and factories, her chemistry research that allows her to better understand the process, and her personal experience in manufacturing soap. Both Professors Sleeper-Smith and Marrero work in the western Great Lakes, where Sleeper-Smith examines womens role in the fur trade and Marrero explores the Indigeneous-French culture of nineteenth-century communities near Detroit. Sleeper-Smith examines the prosperity that the fur trade brought to Indigenous communities through the trade silver that was manufactured to obtain Indian peltry and its extensive proliferation to show how the fur trade was indicative of  Indigenous prosperity, rather than decline and demise. Marrero shows the prevalence of music and song as a medium of cultural transmission in Great Lakes French communities. Professor Marreros research incorporates the hybrid songs that characterized the shared culture of French and Indigenous nations. Professor Sleeper-Smith will display a small collection of Indigenous silver objects to discuss their meanings in Indigenous culture. Professor Marrero will sing and analyze one of the songs that embodies the musical tradition of French Detroit. </p>","Soap, Silver, And Song: Experiential History In Research And Teaching"

First, our panel consists of two academic historians and one filmmaker who is a professor of communications. We will compare the possibilities and pitfalls of telling black womens stories in the traditional form of biography versus the format of film. Second, our panel considers the forms that biography takes when the subjects present challenges to linear storytelling. Blairs paper addresses the secrecy that enveloped the life of comedian Jackie Moms Mabley. How to construct a life narrative of Jackie Mabley, a woman who strenuously resisted incursions into her private life, often revising previous renditions of her past?  Mabley presents a challenge to her biographer, not only because she so skillfully managed her public persona, but because both her comedic dissemblance and her secrets register personal trauma and reflect the changing racial, gender, and sexual politics of her times.  Blair explores the challenges presented by Mableys life story and the craft of biography.Hudson, in her paper about the expatriate and psychoanalyst Marie Battle Singer, examines the self-fashioning that Singer practiced in her career abroad. Singer migrated to Germany in the 1940s, and then to London where she studied with Anna Freud and set up practice on Harley Street. In oral histories with Singers friends and family, Hudson (and her co-author) has discovered a wide range of tales that Singer told in order to place herself in a black world that the British would recognize. Singer was especially fond of linking herself to the history of slavery; she regularly described herself as the granddaughter of illiterate slaves even though her grandparents operated a secondary school in Okolona, Mississippi. This paper investigates the form this biography might take given the stories and fabrications Singer created about herself.Davis faces some of the same problems of fabrication as she wrestles with the stories of jazz musician Clora Bryant and abolitionist Sojourner Truth. Davis explores the form of African American women&quot;s biography in her paper about her films: the documentary feature, &quot;Trumpetistically Clora Bryant&quot; and her current experimental work in progress, &quot;The Way of Truth: A Meditation on Sojourner Truth.&quot;  Both women presented challenges to Davis as she translated their lives in film. Clora Bryants fifty year career in the jazz world of Los Angeles provided Davis with compelling material as a storyteller. Yet Davis faced important questions about form and narrative.  Sojourner Truths life, as historians have documented, is filled with myths and silences. In this new project, Davis aims to explore Truths control over her representation. All three papers will address questions that animate the work of historians and filmmakers: How should the narrator handle the significant silences that attach themselves to black womens lives? Which forms, in either genre, are best-suited to tell the story of womens lives? How should the voice of the narrator come through (or not) in the story? Are there new forms of writing and filming black womens biography that we might pursue?</p>","Storytelling And African American Women's Biography"

While early works on Pentecostal history were largely written by ministers untrained in scholarly techniques, more recently, scholars devoted to appropriate disciplinary methodologies have published a wide range of works.  These scholars are academics, like the ones on this panel, and may hold positions in a variety of institutions, some seminaries, some private universities, and some public colleges. To what degree this more secular approach will be accepted by more traditional Pentecostal institutions is currently under debate.  The editors of Pneuma, the Journal for the Society of Pentecostal Studies, a group largely comprised of those with Pentecostal affiliations, wrote in Fall 2016 that the field should expand and move toward theoretical discourses in the social sciences, physical sciences, and comparative religion. Papers such as the ones proposed in this panel are key to expanding the field in this direction.In addition, while early Pentecostal histories documented the lives of the mostly male ministers, these historians are also concerned with recovering the pasts of those often left out of the traditional narratives. In particular, this panel discusses the ways in which Pentecostal women often subverted traditional forms of authority while also upholding church teachings.  The Pentecostal movement benefited from the work of women, both in the ministry and in the laity. Women contributed to the ongoing theological and political debates within their ranks. The role of women both in society and in the church was of concern to the movement. Women in the ministry often faced discriminatory policies such as licensing restrictions that limited their roles in the church and meant they were always in danger of losing their pulpits.  Despite these restrictions, women often either ignored or found ways to work around such rules.  Women in the pews also contributed to building the physical church, often by providing the funding for the construction of new facilities.  Mexican-American women in California, for example, sold tamales, a product usually created through communal labor.  In this way, the kitchen became a place where these women both upheld and challenged Pentecostal teachings. Discussions about such women have the ability to help Pentecostals reexamine their narratives and to create more inclusive ones. </p>","Subverting Authority: The Pentecostal Women Who Built Their Movements"

This panel will contribute to this historiography by focusing on Chicago in the Twentieth Century. By examining various groups of people who sought to take control of their economic futures, this panel will consider the evolving methods by which the economically marginal responded to the forces of capitalism. Whether through participating in extra-legal gambling, protesting for relief, or pressuring financial institutions to expand lending policies, this panel finds that urban residents pushed against economic constraints to protest the ramifications of American capitalist practices and improve their lives. In the process, this panel will assess the historic possibilities and limitations of taking control of economies.In Policy Gambling as Black Womens Work and Black Womens Space, Betsy Schlabach (Associate Professor of History, Earlham College) finds that African American women in Chicago used policy gambling as a source of employment and security, but that same security was compromised by the mobility and evasiveness the work required. Using arrest records and following the daily habits of African American women policy workers, Schlabach concludes that work in the policy industry demanded simultaneous visibility and invisibility, an impossible task. In Unemployed Workers, Urban Reformers, and the Fate of Capitalism in 1930s Chicago, Abigail Trollinger (Assistant Professor of History, St. Norbert College) centers on the Workers Committee on Unemployment, a Depression-era organization through which jobless workers called for more relief funds and an end to casework. Trollinger demonstrates that, in partnering with moderate reformers and distancing themselves from Communist rhetoric, these WCOU workers committed to reshaping, rather than abandoning, American capitalism. Finally, in Urbanites Fight for Capital during 1980s Financial Deregulation, Rebecca Marchiel (Assistant Professor of History, University of Mississippi) explores the activism of the urban reinvestment movement, a multiracial coalition of low- and moderate-income urbanites, founded in Chicago in 1972. Marchiel shows that activists – responding to 1980s budget cuts and changes to federal banking regulations that created new openings and obstacles for residents of capital-starved neighborhoods – successfully partnered with banks to expand affordable housing opportunities in Chicago, but in doing so foreclosed more equitable alternatives for urban revitalization. Together, these three papers offer a landscape of the economically disadvantaged in Chicago who, over the course of the twentieth century, made claims to their economic fates and ultimately altered the meaning and practice of capitalism in the city.The chair and discussant is Jon Shelton, Assistant Professor of Democracy and Justice Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.

Even as historians have made immense strides to reveal the complex worlds of indigenous and Hispanic peoples whom this conquest overran, their stories are still framed as foreordained declension stories: of course the United States military and demographic dominance would eventually subsume the West.  Yet, as this roundtable will discuss, neither the United States nor most of its citizens assumed inevitable U.S. triumph.  On the contrary, the future of the West remained fluid, and federal officials and American settlers responded to this fluidity by experimenting with permanent alternatives to U.S. dominance.Building upon their contributions to the special issue of the Pacific Historical Review Alternative Wests: Rethinking Manifest Destiny (February 2016), the panelists will discuss the many narratives that contradict the story of inevitable U.S. expansion, particularly those that were voiced and acted out by Americans themselves: the creation of independent governments in Florida, Texas, Oregon, and Utah; the willingness of U.S. officials to seek out Native people as allies and cater to their wishes; the varied imaginings of different – and permanent – western polities among countless Americans; and the many migrations and trading partnerships that directly countered U.S. western expansion.  The panel will thus explore various means to disentangle western and U.S. history from the trope of Manifest Destiny, and offer historiographical paths that reveal the complexity – and even unlikelihood – of U.S. conquest.</p>","Taking The State Back Out: The Irrelevance Of The Federal Government In The West, 1803-1861"

Recently, however, Boston Public Schools and area universities have encouraged students to interrogate mandatory busing and challenge the dominant narrative, which emphasizes the policys failure, by examining why African-American activists fought for years to end Bostons policies of de facto segregation. Spurred on by the 40th anniversary marking court-ordered integration and the resulting citywide remembrances, area archival repositories identified and digitized relevant primary sources.The digitizing of the historical record led, in turn, to the establishment of a multi-institutional digital archive that houses material from several repositories with differing missions and collecting foci.  Inter-archival collaborators collected material on the same subject from widely different perspectives – government and school officials, the courts, anti-busing and integrationist activists, parents, students, and educators – to present a more complicated and nuanced narrative of desegregation.  Educators then used the digital archive to create primary-source-based curricula for elementary, secondary, and college students. The resulting learning modules emphasize student acquisition of the critical stance needed to think historically, interpret and evaluate data, and to engage in meaningful civic participation.  Further, students could understand how authority is constructed and contextualized, thereby gaining knowledge of how archives are organized by human decisions, and how humans shape archives and, in turn, historical interpretation.  Presenters will discuss the development of inter-institutional collaborations among archivists, activists and educators, and the value of primary-source-based curricula for the teaching of historical, information, and civic literacy.  Participants will leave with a blueprint for creating inter-archival collaborations on any topic using available digital tools and services.</p>","Teaching Contested History: Digital Archives And Digital Maps"

Even before smartphones and streaming video and before Google became a verb, Neil Postman looked forward into the future of technology while simultaneously reaching back for the wisdom of educator John Dewey: The best way for citizens to protect their liberty is for them to be encouraged to be skeptical, to be suspicious of authority, and to be prepared (and unafraid) to resist propaganda.1 Dewey and Postmans admonitions have only become more relevant in the 21st century. Teaching students to think critically has always been central to our work as history educators, and has become even more essential in the digital age.  Digital forms of history create new epistemological realities and dilemmas that impact the construction of historical knowledge. Historical information in the form of websites, blogs, newsfeeds, social media posts, and other items generated in google searches greatly impacts how students come to know history in the 21st century. And in a culture of google-knowing, what some have termed a post-fact age, student often mistakenly imbue online information with authority without first considering how to evaluate it.  The superabundance of instant online content requires that students master the ability to evaluate sources. This roundtable will feature a lively discussion among historians from around the nation that represent historical pedagogy across several segments: the high school, the community college, and the 4-year college. These panelists represent historians who are committed to student success and critical thinking development, as well as harnessing the advantages (and disadvantages) of the internet in creative and timely ways. A useful and relevant discussion, both philosophical and practical, will cover of the impact of digital information on student thinking and the use of the digital media into our classrooms.The audience will be invited to join the panelists in discussing:•The impact of the internet and social media on student thinking, assumptions, and skills.•Designing pedagogy in a culture of google-knowing.•Best practices in teaching students to evaluate online information and sources; how to increase students&quot; abilities to find, ethically use, synthesize, and evaluate information from electronic media.

This shift towards an inward looking American nationalism poses unique challenges for U.S. historians working abroad. Many students attending foreign universities have reacted negatively to Americas rising anti-immigrant sentiment, saber-rattling against longtime foes, and new conflicts with traditional allies. For some students this hostility manifests as disinterest in courses on United States history. For others, it has increased interest for more focused explanations of the current climate. Rather than ignoring these issues, historians abroad are grappling with ways to address them in their courses while still covering basics about U.S. history that are sometimes taken for granted in American classrooms. To consider these strategies, the roundtable brings together historians from four continents and four countries (Canada, Brazil, Germany, and Qatar) to consider these questions. The historians include both scholars teaching in English-language institutions and those teaching at non-English universities as well as a range of experience from early to late career scholars.</p>","Teaching U.S. History Overseas In A Time Of Only America First"

This workshop will provide strategies and resources that demonstrate how putting food in the forefront when we teach history helps students identify and better understand connections across categories like race and class, and also across borders. Using three examples of topics common to US history survey courses -- European colonies, Progressive era reforms, and the Civil Rights Movement -- and digital archives, the leaders of the workshop will help workshop participants to develop their own assignments that use food history to enrich or deepen understanding of common subjects in US history. Edible items themselves may not be preserved, but their packaging, promotional materials and governing paperwork live on in archives and private collections. Using in-room computers, we will place educators into working groups to explore digital archives such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Agricultural Library, and some hidden gems such as the recipes printed in Nation of Islams The Daily Call. This workshop will provide teaching tools for educators to:1. Illustrate how food provides insight to social and cultural movements across history.2. Emphasize the critical role that food has played in creating geo-political boundaries and relationships between American regions and foreign countries.3. Explore the idea of food physically as well as metaphorically sustaining the people of the United States.</p>","The Edible Intersectional: A Teaching Guide"

Diner (New York University)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2018-04-13</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 08:00 to 09:30</h5></p><p><h5><b>Location:</b> <a href='http://www.oah.org/meetings-events/2018/sessions/' style='color:#6CADC7'>OAH Schedule</a></h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Session</h5></p><p>This session aims to start a conversation between historians of migration and historians of emotion. As titles such as Oscar Handlins The Uprooted attest, emotions have often surfaced in histories of migration, but the subfield has yet to incorporate the insights of scholars who study emotion systematically. This oversight constitutes an opportunity missed since foregrounding emotion has the potential to provide fresh answers to enduring questions: How do migrants attachments to their old and new homelands change over time? To what extent do emotional—not economic—imperatives shape migration? What is the lived experience of migration? Ultimately, taking emotion seriously might also alter the forms that historians use to engage students and the public.In the past few decades, historians of emotions have conceptualized—and debated—how inner feelings relate to language, how personal emotions interact with communal norms, and how emotions change over time. Historians of the United States lag behind their Europeanist colleagues, but they are beginning to recognize that emotions have a history and emotions make history.  A few trailblazers have suggested the potential benefits of careful attention to the emotions of migration in particular. Hasia Diner, a leading scholar of migration, first made the case in a programmatic essay in 1998. One response has come from an historian of emotions. Susan Matts Homesickness (2011) argued that homesickness, although widespread among migrants, was ultimately suppressed in the interests of fostering a mobile workforce. Historians who work on immigrant correspondence, such as David Gerber, Sonia Cancian, and Suzanne Sinke, discuss adaptation in terms of emotions. In related fields, literary scholars such as Jeffrey Santa Ana and Madelaine Hron have analyzed emotion in immigrant writing, and Paolo Boccagni and Loretta Baldassar recently called for more sociological research on emotions and migration. These forays have yet to ignite a sustained exchange, the goal of this session. The case studies in the first two papers bring emotion to established scholarly debates over community formation and information exchange. Alison Clark Efford (Marquette University) will use the documentation of German immigrant suicide to argue that even individual feelings of dislocation are best studied in the context of immigrant communities. Suzanne Sinke (Florida State University) will examine how and why the letters of Austrian refugees revealed or repressed certain emotions. In the third paper, Ana Elizabeth Rosas (University of California, Irvine) opens the conversation to questions of form by discussing a student-curated exhibition on the emotive underpinnings of the material culture of Mexican immigrants.Commentator Susan Matt (Weber State University) will ensure that we generate the sort of meaningful discussion that is not always achieved in the traditional conference session. As an established scholar of emotions, Dr. Matt will suggest how feelings might change histories of migration—in interpretation and form—and encourage audience contributions. As chair and second commentator, Hasia Diner (New York University), past president of the Immigration and Ethnic History Society and author of eleven books, adds weight and coherence to the session. Dr. Diners comments will be brief.  </p>","The Emotions Of Migration"

The purpose of this chat seminar is to grow a supportive community that is engaged with the work of campus history projects at public and private institutions of higher education, sites which we understand as important spaces in which Americans engage with the nations past.In the five years since Craig Steven Wilders foundational _Ebony and Ivy: Race, Slavery, and the Troubled History of Americas Universities_ (2013), faculty, students, and administrators have found themselves involved in a wide range of campus history projects that often engage with current campus conversations about diversity, inclusion, and access. In line with the OAH 2018 conference theme, The Forms of History, the chat seminar will move beyond the scholarly monograph and foster conversations about campus histories and the forms in which those histories are represented at our institutions, with particular attention to the value of shared authority between faculty, students, librarians and archivists, alumni, and other campus constituencies.  From exhibitions, courses, and internships, to teach-ins, walking tours, and digital repositories, to oral history collecting and archives building, to performances and other creative projects, there is a growing network of resources and models for this work.  What are the tools we need to propose or contribute to campus history efforts? How do we respond to critics, both inside of and outside our institutions? Who will document these modern-day struggles over the presence of the past and the power of place in the campus context? Looking at race and racism in elite higher education should also suggest other historical moments with which we still grapple: the radical transgression of suggesting women deserved an education equal to that of men; of suggesting that non-white students could share a classroom with white students; of suggesting that the economically disadvantaged college student or the first generation college student (or the differently abled college student) deserves a seat at the table. Chat moderator Monica L. Mercado has advised and coordinated campus history projects at the University of Chicago, Bryn Mawr College, and Colgate University. In 2015-2016 she was an organizer of the National Council of Public History working group Campus History as Public History. Participants in the chat seminar will think critically about the stories we tell about our campuses and the archives we use to tell them, and share strategies for creating or supporting projects that document contemporary and diverse histories of colleges and universities. </p>","The Forms Of Campus History"

Specifically, the papers examine how reformers and progressives called for US interventions in and commercial and cultural interactions with the Global South as solutions to matters of race, empire, and labor that they framed as questions or problems—i.e., the Negro Question, the African Question, the Philippine Question, the Race Question, and the Colonial Question, to name a few. Scholarship on the history of American foreign relations during the Gilded Age and Progressive Era has increasingly highlighted the actions of non-state actors, informal diplomats, and cultural diplomats who sought to influence international relations and US diplomacy during the period. As Michael Hogan argues in Paths to Power (2000) this new history focuses on traditional nonstate actors (i.e., corporations, labor unions, banks, and agricultural interests) and less traditional private actors (i.e., minorities) (7). In addition, it is attentive to the influence of race, racism, gender, class, ideology, popular culture, and rhetoric on American diplomacy. Each panelist situates his or her paper in this broader scholarship and turn in the history of American foreign relations. Moreover, they seek to contribute to ongoing discussions about the importance of Gilded Age and Progressive Era transnationalism.</p>","The Making Of The Global South In The U.S. Gilded Age And Progressive Era Imaginary"

Focusing on a wide range of performances by and of American women between 1850 and 1960, across genres from tragedy to sheet music, southern vaudeville to flamenco dance, this panel interrogates how gendered performances and imagery in a variety of contexts expanded notions of femininity and womanhood. These papers explore tensions and contradictions in images and narratives of women and chart the relationship between new genres of performance and shifting consumption practices of gendered and raced audiences.Starting in the 1850s, Sara Lampert examines the transformation of the tragedy Camille on the American stage, as touring actresses popularized new versions of the drama. Lampert argues that the Americanization of this play, as it shifted from sentimental morality tale to a raw portrayal of a prostitute, makes visible the shifting gender politics of entertainment in the mid-nineteenth century. Actresses popularized forms of French melodrama that involved new discussions of womens sexual agency and in the process connected with expanding female publics. Next, Gillian Rodger turns to sheet music images of burlesque and variety actresses active during the 1870s and 1880s in order to explore the ways that sexualized images considered solely for male audiences co-existed with images of the same actresses that were considered palatable for middle-class family settings. Rodger examines how these womens performances and skills complicate simple assumptions about the appeal they held for their male audiences.Focusing on the Jim Crow era and segregated black vaudeville and minstrelsy circuits in the South, Cookie Woolners paper looks at how representations of same-sex desire and gender transgression were depicted in this milieu. She argues that songs by blues women about mannish women and sissy men, along with performances by female impersonators hailed black queer audiences in a time before African Americans were welcome in gay bars, positioning black traveling shows as an important site through which to imagine queer life in the South. Rosanne Sia will then take up the Cold War era as the context for examining how Asian American and Tejana dancers used their performances to rework the racialized and sexualized tropes into which their audiences cast them at this time of U.S Empire. Sia uses oral history to open up readings of these womens performances, considering the multiple levels through which they used the live body to critique and reimagine American mythologies of racial democracy.</p>","The Many Imaginaries Of Female Performance, 1850-1960"

Slavery advocates, for their part, deployed a number of strategies for pushing an agenda that would both ensure the spread of the institution into these new lands and guard against prohibitive national legislation. This panel explores those multifarious methods and tactics, which ranged from lobbying territorial legislatures to outright filibustering. Too often, however, the literature on slavery and southern interest in the Trans-Mississippi West focuses heavily on familiar debates in Congress and their consequences for eastern politics. In contrast, this panel will reorient the conversation to the western battlegrounds themselves to consider local conditions and discussions about the viability of slavery. In doing so, it will demonstrate how established communities in these far-flung lands confronted southern expansionism and shaped or molded it to their advantage. Southern dreams of empire ultimately hinged on the ability of advocates to navigate the whirlwind of competing nation-states, local elites, and various interest groups in the American borderlands. The southern impetus to see slavery proliferate arguably drove U.S. territorial growth during this period, but western interests determined whether those efforts succeeded or, more often than not, fizzled.In roundtable format, this panel brings together scholars at different stages in their careers to discuss particular cases of pro-slavery expansionism. Each presentation will move the view westward, beginning with Texas, shifting toward the continental interior, and concluding on the Pacific coast. Maria Angela Diaz argues that southerners in the Gulf South embraced Texas as a model and staging ground for expansionist ventures into Latin America, challenging typical geographic conceptualizations of the South, Southwest, and Gulf of Mexico as distinct regions. Similarly, the movement of Anglo-American cotton farmers into Coahuila y Tejas in the 1820s sparked heated debates over slavery in northeastern Mexico that, according to Andrew Torget, culminated in an independent Texas. Matthew Saionz, in turn, explores how the Republic of Texas worked to secure an empire of its own during the early 1840s when its leaders aimed to enforce territorial claims in New Mexico and gain control of the Santa Fe trade. Taking us further westward, Kevin Waite contextualizes the pro-slavery, separatist movements of Arizona and California during the 1850s to consider the numerous ways that antebellum partisans attempted to remake the North American map for slaveholding interests. Stacey Smith argues that southern migrants in California, hoping to contest free soil ideology in the gold mines, pursued other benefits from taking slaves to the Pacific Coast that did not rely on successfully establishing the institution there. To conclude, William Deverell will discuss how Civil War veterans looked upon the West as convalescent space, even as it reverberated with sectional tensions. Collectively, this roundtable offers new perspectives on the interplay of slavery and U.S. expansion and emphasizes the contingency of southern empire-building in the context of borderland politics. </p>","The Old South In The New West: Southern Expansionism And Empire-Building In The American Borderlands"

More specifically, we propose three papers that consider the punk experience of the 1970s and 1980s as vehicle for political expression and engagement.  In the landslide of recent books on post-1960s American politics, punk is almost entirely absent.  When historians have written about punk in their sweeping chronicles of American political realignment, it has been dismissively, finding that American punk lacked the political edge of British punk or served merely as a rebel pose (Bruce Schulman, for example, derided arch-political band Dead Kennedys as poseurs, seemingly devoted only to flouting established notions of good taste).  This dismissal of punk results in a curious omission of youth politics even as cultural studies scholars have, for decades, shown so clearly that young peoples political experience in this period was increasingly tied to the arts, especially music and performance.  The three papers in this panel take up this alternative form of political history, considering the question of punk politics vis-à-vis mainstream and radical politics by presenting a mix of less conventional historical sources.  These include film and music clips, images and text from underground punk zines and recent oral history interviews.  Each paper grows out of the presenters current research projects.We propose to consider punk as an historical phenomenon and process that broadens our understanding of the forms of American political experience.  Céline Murillo (Université Sorbonne Paris Cité) will present some of her current research on New York City punk films, seeing the films themselves as political acts per se as well as transmitters of political criticism of failed social and economic urban policy.  Michael Stewart Foley (Université Grenoble Alpes) will examine San Francisco punk politics as an early challenge to neoliberal urban policy, showing how punks made common cause with tenants rights, gay rights, and police reform groups while carving out and defending pockets of urban space for their own community.  And Kevin Mattson (Ohio University) will take a national view of hardcore punk in the 1980s, highlighting the tension that existed at times between the politics within punk and the intervention of punks in national and local political issues.  Taken together, the papers recover subsets of a national subculture engaged in serious political work, even as constraints from within and without became apparent.  In keeping with the Program Committees call for proposals, and consistent with punks insistent call to break down the barrier between audience and artist/presenter, we will chair the panel ourselves and ask the audience to serve as commentator.  This will allow for maximum interaction with the audience.  </p>","The Politics Of Punk In The 1970s And 1980s"

Additionally, much of the scholarship focuses on a suburban and urban split. These dichotomies certainly exist, but by themselves often distort the role of the city in the development of conservative politics. However broadly we choose to define conservatism, some of its more lasting and effective means of mobilization were forged in the crucible of urban contexts. Questions surrounding poverty, housing, and especially crime animated conservative discourse throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Republicans and Democrats adopted conservative frameworks in addressing these urban issues and each advanced and negotiated the rise of neoliberal governance in their own way.  Therefore, it was these urban political laboratories that incubated the conditions for a national rightward turn, with each unique strand coalescing into the Reagan Revolution of 1980.Timothy Lombardos paper concentrates on blue collar conservatism in 1960s and 1970s Philadelphia, moving the lens of scholarly emphasis away from suburbia and instead analyzing the ways in which urban and working-class whites engaged in the selective rejection of liberalism. In addition to redefining spatial assumptions regarding conservatism, Lombardo also challenges regional ones by demonstrating the influence of conservative politics in the liberal northeast. Benjamin Holtzmans paper examines the ways in which grassroots organizing in 1970s New York City manifested in response to the perceived failure of government to prevent crime. The resulting conservative neoliberal law-enforcement apparatus was therefore the result of populist mobilization and not simply the creation of powerful elites (as is often posited). Dan Elkins paper focuses on conservative politics in 1970s San Diego and the uneasy relationship between middle class populism and neoliberal urban development. As Americas Finest City became more reliant on immigrant labor, there also existed a rising tension with the perceived sieve-like border conditions and their supposed connection to crime. Navigating these competing currents, without rejecting either one, became an essential formula to conservative politics in the borderlands.Taken together, these papers hope to advance the discussion on conservative politics in two distinct ways: first by locating some of their more lasting legacies in urban contexts, and second by demonstrating that conservative interactions with neoliberal development did not adhere to predictable patterns or familiar categorizations.</p>","The Right And Cities: Postwar Conservatisms Urban Roots"

Panel participants will discuss some of the key themes, vital lessons, and exceptional insights that the book illuminates in the course of its eighteen essays. These include: the daunting challenges but also the rewards that many women encounter as they pursue a life of the mind; the significance of mentorship in the field of history and academia more generally; the tangible and intangible importance of financial support to scholars without resources; the state of the historical profession and academia; the commitment to not only writing histories of women but also preserving their voices in archives.  The panelists will also explore the sometimes unrecognized ways that historical subjects we write about have served as inspirations in our own lives.  And finally, participants will reflect on the challenges and opportunities of writing and editing a collection of mini-biographies, an exercise most historians neither engage in nor are generally comfortable with. Briefly, the book is a collection of essays written by all the winners of the prestigious Catherine Prelinger Award, a $20,000 stipend.  Given annually by the Coordinating Council for Women in History (CCWH) to a scholar of excellence who has not travelled an uninterrupted path from undergraduate study through to a tenure-track position in the academy, the Prelinger Award is among the most generous awards available to scholars studying womens history. The contributors include internationally recognized scholars of womens history as well as more recent scholars at the cutting edge of research. Taken together the eighteen essays demonstrate both the progress womens historians have made in advancing in the profession as well as the persistence of structural and cultural gender-based challenges and expectations that find a disproportionate number of women delaying the start of, or putting on pause for long periods, their goals of becoming professional historians.  At the same time, the essays serve as a testament to the importance of supporting scholars who may not have access to institutional resources.  Over the years, the books contributors have written field-shifting works that have broadened our understanding of U.S. history in many geographic areas, they have written about fantastically diverse topics, including: the history of migrant workers, refugees in the American South West, lesbian feminist print culture of the 1970s and 1980s, Indigenous women in settler-colonial interactions in North America, the challenges of unwelcome trailblazers, including African American women into government agencies. Finally, the contributors give readers a rare and inspiring insight into their tenacious pursuit for a life of the mind and for the determination to make a difference not only in the field of history but also in the lives of women far beyond the gates of the academy. We anticipate that this panel will generate a lively and important discussion about womens status in the profession and as historical subjects.</p>","They Broke Down Barriers: They Transformed History"

Employing the concept of liberty, Hispanic anarchists utilized a transnational print network to build community and promote labor organizing as well as social and economic justice. Despite popular notions that anarchists were simply focused on fomenting chaos and violent revolution, in reality most anarchists primarily desired freedom from traditional forms of political, social and economic oppression. Precisely to avoid the stereotypical misunderstandings of anarchism, many militants therefore embraced flexible, experimental, and even pluralistic approaches to the &quot;anarchist ideal&quot; including support of national values and states as a transitory way to achieve individual freedom and the anarchist society. As historian Kenyon Zimmer has stated, this respect for the individual and corresponding defense of diversity as a positive good in itself formed the core of anarchists cosmopolitan thought and practice. (Zimmer, Immigrants Against the State, 210). The underlying theme of this session is that the political, social and economic contexts in Spain and Latin America deeply influenced Hispanic anarchists in the U.S. These presentations therefore acknowledge and expand on the work of James Baer, Jesse Cohn, Montse Feu, Tom Goyens, Jennifer Guglielmo, Lily Litvak, Jorell Meléndez-Badillo, Kirwin Shaffer, Travis Tomchuk, David Turcato, and Kenyon Zimmer all of whom emphasize the various ways in which national boundaries became less meaningful to anarchists. The papers also build on the transnational theory put forth by Nicolás Kanellos on Latino culture in the United States: … from its origins in the early nineteenth century to the present, [it] has been a transnational phenomenon, one that crosses borders physically or symbolically or in both ways, constructs more than one national identity at a time or deconstructs and rejects them all (Kanellos, Hispanic Immigrant Literature, 34). To interrogate these themes and issues, this session examines four seminal episodes of the Hispanic anarchist experience in North America. Kirwin Shaffer explores the anarchist print network of the late 19th through early 20th century that connected Spanish-speaking libertarians in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Florida. Chris Castaneda then describes the ways in which Spanish-born anarchists based in New York began to dialogue with other U.S.-based anarchists including Ricardo Flores Magón on the West Coast. Sonia Hernandez examines the emergence of an anarchist community during the early 20th century in the Texas-Tamaulipas borderlands. Montse Feu concludes the session by exploring the ways in which Spanish anarchist writers and literary figures in the U.S. depicted the Spanish Civil War and its legacy. As a group, these presentations focus on the achievements of the often marginalized, yet influential, Hispanic anarchists who promoted libertarian ideals along with revolutionary social, political, and economic change in the United States. </p>","Transnational Hispanic Anarchists: The North American Experience"

Food offers insight into intimate, everyday practices and ideas at the same time that they depend, as the panels papers show, on global exchanges of knowledge, resources, and people.  This panel, by exploring the conjoined migrations of people and foods, illuminates an underexplored connection binding the Pacific world in the long-20th century.  This adds to the burgeoning literature of the Pacific world, a world system as critical to U.S. history as the Atlantic one but still far less studied.  Further, it underscores Japan and its links with the United States in that world.  Japan has long been overshadowed by China, which is positioned along with the United States in both the scholarly and popular imaginations as a magnetic pole of the region.  Yet, running below contemporaneous, near-mythical ideas about China was a far more consistent U.S.-Japanese trade and far more explosive imperial competition.  Finally, this panel adds to the conceptualization of the Japanese diaspora, which has been undertheorized in the historical literature.  However, as these papers make clear, Japanese migrants and their children continued to be linked in various ways to their home nation, while their actions further entangled Japan with the United States and contributed to Japanese imperialism as well as postwar Japanese and U.S. expansionisms.  The first two papers explore the inter-imperial movements between Japan, Taiwan, and territorial Hawaii.  Mariko Iijima follows Japanese migrants as agents of shared coffee-producing skills and materials between U.S. Hawaii and Japanese Taiwan; these migrants, Iijima argues, helped motor the coffee industry in these colonies and, perhaps, imperial control.  Eiichiro Azuma examines the pineapple in a similar narrative of interwar, intercolonial transfers of knowledge and migrants; he argues that Japanese imperial ideologies of overseas racial development, U.S. frontier myths, as well as shifting local conditions help us understand Japanese migrants diasporic movements and the inter-imperial exchanges.  The second two papers shift to the second generation, to continue the story of ethnics and their role in, rather than imperialisms, Japanese and U.S. expansionism.  Robert Hegwood explores their place in the transformation of U.S. tastes; Hegwood examines the massive U.S. postwar popularity of sukiyaki to argue that a range of Japanese American entrepreneurs reshaped U.S. ideas about Japanese food and culture, paving the way for the explosive popularity of Japanese foods and products.  Meredith Oda narrates the Cold War trajectory of imported Japanese soy sauce in the United States from a disparaged specialty item to a pantry staple; she argues this depended on not just taste, industry adaptations, and a persistent ethnic entrepreneur, but also the suburbanization of Asian Americans who provided a growing foundation for national markets.  Together, these papers stake the particular, contingent, and localized roots of transpacific circulations of Japanese/American people and goods.</p>","Transpacific Circulations Of Japanese People And Foods"

A jury convicted eight--though their &quot;crime&quot; consisted of working to organize those at the bottom of the social ladder--and a judge sentenced them to prison.  This shocking episode was not an isolated phenomenon, because the Golden State saw many fierce struggles to organize in the fields and food-processing plants during the Great Depression--and also intense anti-communism.I began studying these struggles when working on my Stanford dissertation about cannery workers in the Santa Clara Valley (now Silicon Valley) during the 1930s.  That research became the germ of a book, SILICON VALLEY, WOMEN, AND THE CALIFORNIA DREAM.  I subsequently held a Fulbright Chair in Moscow and had the opportunity to use the Comintern archives and examine the reports of CP organizers in the Valley in the early 30s--though this research has been shared only at a conference in Moscow.  Still very interested in the role of the CP in California, I am currently awaiting the FBI file of a woman fired as a school principal in a small southern California town for being an unfriendly witness before HUAC.When I read that the OAH would be in Sacramento, it occurred to me that this would be an excellent venue for a roundtable on the subject of California Communism.  I was aware of new work and of projected work on this topic, so I contacted various scholars, all of whom were enthusiastic.  This roundtable will examine such topics as these:  Does Carey McWilliams&quot;s formulation of &quot;California:  the Great Exception&quot; work for California Communism?  How did CP women fare?  How much interest did the CP show in organizing various groups of people of color?  The world has heard a great deal about the Hollywood blacklist, but what about other victims of Cold War anxieties?  Where in the state was the CP most successful?  What other industries other besides entertainment, maritime commerce, and food saw CP organizing efforts?  How did the CP contribute to the development of a Left-Labor culture in San Francisco after World War II and what happened to it?  What was the impact of the Taft-Hartley Act in California during the late 1940s?  What was the relationship between California&quot;s Old Left and the New Left during the 1960s?Besides myself as chair, the other participants would be Robert Cherny, author of two journal articles on the California CP and a forthcoming book on a Communist artist in San Francisco; Renato Barahona, an Iberianist now working on Rose Isaak and her involvement with the San Francisco American Russian Institute, which appeared on the Attorney General&quot;s list; Beth Slutsky, author of GENDERING RADICALISM:  WOMEN AND COMMUNISM IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY CALIFORNIA; and Lisa Jackson, a graduate student working on putting California&quot;s CP women into an international context.</p>","Twentieth-Century Communism In The Golden State:  A Roundtable"

This was because more than one-fifth of CSU students enrolled in the survey earned a failing grade or withdrew from the class. In the CSUs, such &quot;bottlenecks&quot; affect tens of thousands of students every year--20,000 freshmen earned one or more repeatable grades in the Fall 2015 term alone. Intense institutional scrutiny of &quot;low success&quot; bottlenecks has followed from detailed data &quot;dashboards.&quot; At the moment, history survey courses are viewed as something of a foil to &quot;student success,&quot; a political and educational imperative in public universities today. Evidence also suggests that when students fail or must pay to repeat an entry-level course such as US history, there are considerable psychic as well as economic consequences for California&quot;s middle-class families. This scrutiny has left historians in the CSU system feeling somewhat vulnerable.  Over the past three and 1/2 years, approximately 30 historians working across 23 separate campuses have worked together to substantially &quot;redesign&quot; both how we teach and what we teach in lower-division US history survey courses. We have also used technology more purposefully, with deeper integration with our course goals.  Further, we have been compelled to see these classes as much more than entry-level history courses:  They are gateways to college degrees and college &quot;success.&quot;  We have also delved deeply into what students bring to our classes, both in terms of disciplinary bias and financial insecurity. We are now launching what is perhaps the largest survey and and most rigorous assessment of its kind:  A tool to better understand what helps first-year students do well in US history survey classes and what &quot;success&quot; looks like in a course that combines study of American institutions and government over time with close attention to historical thinking skills.  We want to share this critical work because we have some concern that our institutional and political leaders might well find the study of US history at the lower-division level too expensive to sustain for all CSU students.  In that worst-case scenario, History Departments at the California State University would be teaching thousands fewer students each year.  Our department faculties would further shrink, and the impact on the job market for Ph.Ds and for the field generally would be potentially great.  History and the liberal arts generally might not be able to regain that lost ground. We believe we are finding new ways to demonstrate both the value of such classes, as well as the value students place on them. These classes desperately need close attention now.  At this time, more than 30 CSU historians have entirely overhauled the way they teach these classes.  We are getting to a better understanding of the consequences of these changes for students and for our institutions.  We would like to share that with the OAH in Sacramento, where so many critical decisions about public higher education in California are made. </p>","Undermining Student Success?:  How U.S. History Surveys Landed On The Chancellor's Shortlist For Low-Success Courses And What 30 Csu Historians Did About It "

Building off recent literature that shows how historical actors continued to maintain a color-conscious praxis in putatively race-neutral aspects of urban planning, such as architecture, taxation, and transportation, this panel seeks to highlight discursive reassessments proposed by junior urbanists that explains how the devaluation of black residents in American metropolitan development has perpetuated the salience of racial inequality even as civic discourse surrounding race and racial inequality has shifted toward color-blindness. </p>","Valued Properties: Color-Consciousness In Mid-20th Century Urban Planning And Policy"

Ruíz has been instrumental to the development of numerous generations of women of color in academia during four decades. Her mentoring and innovative research has inspired us to conduct research that builds on her methodological and analytical approaches. This roundtable is composed of five panelists, all Chicana/Latina historians, who will discuss the influence of Dr. Ruízs work and mentoring. Together, they demonstrate the immense influence she has on different generations of Chicana/Latina historians in and outside academia. The first panelist, Dr. Marla Ramírez, recalls reading Vicki Ruízs From Out of the Shadows book as an undergraduate and the impact of learning about first-person accounts through oral history. Eleven years later, she is now writing her first book which also employs oral history to center the voices of repatriated ethnic Mexicans during the Great Depression. Her paper examines the intergenerational gendered experiences and prolonged effects of removal at the turn of the twentieth century while reflecting on Vicki Ruízs research and mentoring. The second panelist, Dr. Mireya Loza, similarly explains that Vicki Ruízs scholarship broadens our understanding of oral history methodology that helps uncover understudied people and their experiences. Dr. Lozas deployment of oral history methods builds on Dr. Ruíz contributions by exploring the intersections of race and sexuality in bracero communities. Her paper focuses on Mexican guest workers narratives that highlight indigenous and sexual identities as lived in labor camps. The third panelist, Dr. Miroslava Chávez-García, highlights that Dr. Ruizs presence in the academy has been a vital component to her research, teaching, and service. Indeed, she credits Dr. Ruíz, with shaping all her research projects – books and articles – as well as her professional accomplishments. Her paper speaks to the ways Dr. Ruízs research on Mexican women in the twentieth century influenced her own research, including her latest book on the emotional and personal impact of migration on Mexican migrants in the 1960s and 1970s.The fourth panelists, Dr. Gabriela Arredondo, underlines that Dr. Ruízs research and mentoring have profoundly influenced her own research trajectory and intellectual development for over two decades. Her paper discusses her current research project on Chicana activists in San Jose, California. Specifically focusing on Wilma Martinez, a key participant in the nationalization of MALDEF in the 1970s. In doing so, she draws on key tenets of Ruízs work to demonstrate her intellectual and methodological contributions to the formulation of this kind of research.The fifth panelist, Dr. Natalia Molina, states that much of what she knows about Chicana/Latina, immigration, labor, and urban history, she learned from reading Dr. Ruízs oeuvre. Her paper discusses her book in-progress, Place-makers and Place-making: The Story of a Los Angeles Community, drawing on the key tenets of Ruízs work to demonstrate how she has shaped a generation. Place-makers examines, Echo Park, an overlooked Los Angeles neighborhood. At the heart of the book is an in-depth look at Mexican restaurants that served as urban institutions that developed the areas social capital in the absence of successful urban programs. </p>","Vicki L.

As the United States and the Soviet Union attempted to manipulate the very shape of the postwar world in their own respective images, this new imperialism yielded both desired and unexpected outcomes. The superpowers drew into their orbit less powerful, emerging countries, many of which were wrestling with the processes of decolonization. This panel compares American public diplomacy efforts in four critical regions of the world during the rise and fall of the Cold War: South Asia, East Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. By developing an expansive and complex public diplomacy apparatus, the U.S. applied cultural, economic, and political strategies to expand their influence and contain communism throughout the Global South.Papers focusing on Pakistan, India, and Taiwan in the postwar decades explore how U.S. state programs for technical and educational development emerged as ideological battlegrounds for support in developing nations but equally, the ways in which local actors leveraged American programming to their own advantage. In the case of South Asia, Uzma Quraishi finds that the promotion of American higher education in Indian and Pakistani universities inadvertently established permanent migratory linkages to the United States. Though the State Department in the postwar years never intended for large numbers of Asians to migrate to the U.S., their actions ultimately helped alter the demographic composition of the U.S. James Lins work shows that covert American funding of the Republic of China (Taiwan or ROC) development was intended to generate broad Third World support for the ROC in the UN. While the U.S. used Taiwanese success as a front to gain UN votes, the ROC applied the same rhetoric of successful modernization to validate its own legitimacy.Papers on Afghanistan and Nicaragua demonstrate the shifting meanings of freedom and human rights as wielded by public diplomacy campaigns, especially during the Reagan administration. Andrew Hammonds paper on the Soviet-Afghan War shows the ways in which freedom was pressed into service by the U.S. in its global struggle against the U.S.S.R. Freedom would become the key term through which the Afghan struggle against the Soviet Union would be understood within the U.S. By analyzing the U.S. Office of Public Diplomacys (OPD) role in subverting the power of Nicaraguas existing leftist government, Mike Schmidli unpacks the dark underbelly of covert action during the late Cold War period. The OPD actively sought to influence thought-leaders in the U.S. in order to mobilize support for American goals of regime change abroad by actively circulating policy-related information among American intellectuals and journalists.Collectively, the papers on this panel suggest that what the U.S. State Department once termed psychological warfare was surprisingly expansive in scope even as it was used to foster support among various publics for American foreign policy aims during the entire Cold War period. Public diplomacy programs were so extensive that they quite often altered the historical trajectories of the countries involved, while frequently undermining these countries claims to self-determination.</p>","Weaving Webs Of Power And Influence: U.S. Cold War Public Diplomacy Across The Global South"

As historians concerned with food politics, we add depth and further nuance to these conversations by bringing a historical perspective to bear on current issues. Indeed, the complex political and ethical problems that loom largest in public consciousness today -- such as poverty, immigration, environmental degradation, corporate responsibility (or lack thereof), and public health -- are made legible and addressable through the lens of food history. Arrangements of power are thrown into sharp relief; assumptions of inevitability and timelessness may be challenged and disrupted; and alternative solutions and frameworks are given a chance to emerge. In this paper panel, we are less concerned with the materiality of food than the material contexts that swirl around foods production, consumption, and distribution, and the activists, workers, businesspeople, and government officials whose legacies have shaped the political economy we must navigate today.Matt Garcia will explore the attempts of an American food conglomerate, the United Fruit Company, to mitigate conditions for workers in Honduras after years of devastating corporate exploitation. Garcias account previews the socially conscious capitalism of the twenty-first century and reveals the limits of ethical business in a context of free trade.Laurie Green turns to a time when public attention to obesity focused foremost on malnutrition among the nations poorest, particularly women suffering not from wrong-headed diets but their forced reliance on starchy and fatty foods instead of fresh and nutritious ones. Her paper shows that in the politics of hunger of the late 1960s and early 1970s, concerned antipoverty activists, medical experts, and liberal officials framed the cure for obesity as an expansion of federal food programs, focusing on structural change instead of personal responsibility. In his treatment of the California-based National Land for People Movement, Mario Sifuentez will broaden our understanding of the meaning of food security by looking at efforts to redistribute land to the people who labored upon it. By focusing on water reclamation as a way to alleviate poverty and develop farmworker power, the National Land for People Movement advanced a radical critique of corporate farming, one that begs consideration in light of Californias current water crisis.Using a meal delivery program for people with AIDS as a case study, Lana Dee Povitz will examine how volunteer ideology, mobilized during the conservative political climate of the 1980s, helped change what it meant to care about AIDS. In preparing gourmet meals for highly stigmatized, suffering people, ordinary New Yorkers found a satisfying and tangible way to make a difference. Simultaneously, the organization&quot;s success minimized the importance of government intervention and elevated private charity as a solution to social ills.&quot;Ethical business,&quot; land use rights, obesity, and questions of responsibility for the public good all remain high-stakes issues. Each participant will conclude his or her paper by addressing the implications for collective problem-solving in the present moment.</p>","Whats This Really About?: Histories Of Food Politics In The Late-Twentieth Century"

Yet the difficulties in maintaining these connections were palpable. The experience of war gave soldiers a different vocabulary, quite literally, from that of citizens on the homefront. Too, as active participants in a war of unprecedented carnage and destruction, soldiers experienced the enormity of human loss and suffering differently from their people at home. As these three papers suggest, soldiers often practiced a delicate balancing act between documenting their wartime experiences and assuring their loved ones that all was well. Peter S. Carmichaels paper, The Importance of Being Cheerful, looks at the letters written by poor and informally educated soldiers, unschooled in epistolary conventions of the mid-nineteenth century. Their lack of formal training, Carmichael asserts, freed their pens from […] formulaic narrative structures, thus allowing them to write unselfconsciously in their letters home. There was nothing unselfconscious in the letters written by the subjects of Timothy J. Williams paper, prisoners of war. As Williams notes, the constraints on subject and page length imposed by camp censors forced prisoners to compose their letters deliberately and consciously. Their prose, unlike Carmichaels soldiers, was most assuredly fettered. Williams argues that the unique epistolary culture created in prison camps ultimately gave rise to a new genre of postwar literature, the prison narrative. These narratives, he concludes, contributed to a vibrant print culture that circulated in the decades following the war. By rehashing old sectional divisions and wartime animosities prison narratives effectively forestalled reconciliationist efforts. Finally, Sarah E. Gardner turns to soldiers epistolary conversations about books, arguing that shared reading often served as a bridge across what seemed unbridgeable. She takes as a case study a wounded Confederate soldiers seemingly odd juxtaposed conversations with his fiancée about a popular British domestic novel, Dinah Craiks Mistress and Maid, and a series of suicides in camp. These discussions about books, she argues, allowed this soldier to discuss not only his profound misery and anxiety but also to reassert his common humanity. Taken together, then, the papers in this session explore connections between the act of soldiering and the composition of letters home by paying close attention to the manner in which soldiers wrote their stories. As the panel demonstrates, how men wrote (language, aesthetic, writing style) can sometimes be as important as what they told.</p>","When All That Is Left Is Words: The Writing Sensibilities Of Civil War Soldiers "

Popular perceptions are matched by a dearth of panels on Puerto Rico at U.S. history conferences and the lamentable reality that many historians of the United States know little about Puerto Rico. Puerto Ricos residents are full U.S. citizens, though they are denied the right to vote for president or congressional representatives. More Puerto Ricans currently live on the mainland than the island. Puerto Ricans constitute the second largest Latino population in the United States. The history of Puerto Rico, however, often falls between the cracks that separate the fields of United States and Latin American history, and is relegated to the margins of those fields. This roundtable addresses the OAHs 2018 conference theme of the forms of United States history by interrogating forms of United States history that place Puerto Rico at the margins; it reconfigures those narratives by placing Puerto Rico at their center. The roundtable brings together experts in the fields of United States, Latin American, and Puerto Rican history—Van Gosse (chair), Marisol LeBrón, Teresita Levy, Lisa Materson, and Margaret Power—to highlight new developments in the study of Puerto Rican history.

Analyses and narratives of alternatives to mainstream society help scholars construct more inclusively representative history and create a usable past. Such interpretations underscore which groups views have triumphed or actions have dominated but foreground the breadth of perceived options at historical moments. Intersectional womens and gender history, the foci of our panelists, are central to reevaluating which and whose stories have been ignored. Alternative narratives also delineate the parameters for social action and creative intervention in earlier eras. This form of historical inquiry, then, speaks directly to dissatisfied students and readers who are searching for models from the past to apply to contemporary proposals for change. Our panel creates a composite sketch of American women who, in claiming public cultural space, stood in radical distinction to the dominant culture. Making their marks between the 1920s and the end of the twentieth century, they stretched the boundaries of expectations—raising possibilities and breaking new terrain for future revolutionaries. Collectively, these papers promise to lend new insights into the role that women have played in forging cultural insurgency.

The roundtable features panelists with different perspectives (environmental, labor, cultural history), and regional emphases (U.S.-Mexico, U.S.-Canada) to the study of migration, labor, and borderlands.Each participant in the roundtable will bring their own expertise to the subject of labor circuits and the production of North American borderlands. Yale Postdoctoral Fellow Maria Quintana moves beyond bi-national frameworks to consider how provisions of the Bracero Program (1942-1964), which centered mainly on Mexican laborers, were extended to incorporate Caribbean labor and how the incarceration of Japanese Americans were framed within the same racial logics of labor importation. Assistant Professor Laura D. Gutiérrez details the consequences of labor migration for sending countries by tracing how the deportation and return migration off workers affected Mexico and the U.S.-Mexico border region in the 20th century. Assistant Professor Holly M. Karibo examines the cultural and social spaces that governed cross-border interactions in the Great Lakes border region despite state control and regulation of illicit economies. Exploring histories of labor importation, repatriation, and illicit economies, our roundtable seeks to continue a discussion and build on the forms of history that search for the symptomatic traces of the excluded. We will discuss innovative methodological practices that attempt to locate the histories of those who remained obscure to state structures/documentation as a means to survive. Conversely, we will consider the ways in which we read state archives against the grain, to find the traces of people impacted by resource extraction, labor economies, commodity flows in the borderlands (Stoler). Our roundtable will also highlight the ways in which labor history has impacted borderlands history and vice versa. The history of labor has been intimately tied to the legal, social, and cultural histories of the North American borderlands, and continues with the more recent scholarship of our panelists and that of Andrés Reséndez (The Other Slavery), Mario Sifuentez (Of Forests and Fields), Mireya Loza (Defiant Braceros), etc. Additionally, rather than focusing on one border region, we will examine the similarities and differences across both the U.S-Mexico and the U.S.-Canada borders. Labor migration flows are never as simple as crossing one boundary. They may require the movement across multiple boundaries within and outside nation-states. Furthermore, these borderlands have been co-constituted, with labor and immigration policies of one impacting the other. We will draw on the audience to add their knowledge of interior, urban, Pacific, Caribbean, and global borderlands to the discussion. And, finally as a group (panelists and audience), we would like to outline future directions (methodologies, research sites/topics, collaborations) for working the borderlands.     </p>","Working The Borderlands"

The Philippines, a colony of the United States since 1898, was invaded just a few hours after Pearl Harbor on December 8, 1941.    On July 14, 2016, the California State Board of Education (SBE) approved its inclusion in the Grade 11 U.S. history curriculum framework (Chapter 16).  Since 2014, Bataan Legacy Historical Society (BLHS) had been working with the California Department of Education&quot;s Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) to include WWII in the Philippines in the history curriculum framework for high school and this is the culmination of its efforts.  This will be the first time that these events will be taught in high schools in California and even in the United States.  Among the topics that are  now included in the curriculum framework are The Philippine Commonwealth; the creation of the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) comprised of Americans and a majority of Filipinos; the disruption of the timetable of the Imperial Japanese Army by the USAFFE Forces despite suffering from massive disease and starvation and fighting without any air support; the Bataan Death March and the thousands of casualties; the role of the Filipino and American guerrillas during the liberation; the American soldiers who were transported in hell ships to labor camps in Asia;  the Battles of Leyte Gulf and the destruction of Manila.  In California, each school district is responsible for the implementation of the curriculum framework in accordance with the local control and accountability plan (LCAP).  BLHS is creating sample lesson plans that can be made available to high school districts to implement the revised history curriculum framework for Grade 11 in accordance with its recommendations that were fully approved by the IQC and the SBE.  BLHS will base its sample lesson plans on its exhibition WWII in the Philippines – The Legacy of Two Nations with an inquiry-based approach that will engage the students to ask strategic questions that can lead them to a better understanding of the past and its relevance to the world that they live in.  This can foster community engagement and conversations that can empower them to become responsible members and future leaders of the community.BLHS has a core of experts in its Educational Advisory Group which consists of members of the academia and the military.  </p>","WWII In The Philippines-The Legacy Of Two Nations"

Presenters will examine how various media and pedagogical practices reach younger students in their classrooms, as well as how scholars can involve young people as historical researchers, documenters, interpreters, readers, contributors, and subjects. The panelists, whose research interests, ranks, and affiliations vary widely, will approach these inquiries with brief comments rooted in their own experiences and a collective goal of drawing audience members into the discussion.Dr. Robert Samuel Smith serves as Director of the Cultures & Communities Program and Associate Vice Chancellor for Global Inclusion & Engagement at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. In addition to acting as chair, his contribution to the round table will highlight the ways that reforms in the criminal justice system, especially the emergence of electronic monitoring, are re-shaping the lives of youth by expanding supervision and carceral experiences to homes and local communities. This research is informed by focus groups with youth under GPS surveillance/electronic monitoring, focus groups with youth service providing agencies, and detailed statistical analyses of Milwaukee County municipalities with regard to arrest, warrant and electronic monitoring data.Christina V Villarreal spent nearly a decade teaching and learning in East Oakland, California where she taught 7th & 8th Social Studies at a co-founded small school. She later served as an assistant principal in Oakland, where she successfully led the design and implementation of a University of California, A-G approved 9th grade Ethnic Studies course. Villarreal has previously taught ethnic studies courses at San Francisco State University, Teachers College, Columbia University, Hunter College, and Harvard University. She is a research fellow at the IUME at Teachers College, Columbia University, and serves as the Director of History & Social Studies Education at Brown University.Barry M.

Within, he assessed the reciprocal relationship between these facets based upon the organization of world labor forces and the consequences of output. Cox and others took into consideration the push and pull between global periphery and hegemony. With this in mind—and including direction from liberal or socialist states—how do historical interpretations of production, power, and world order fit into our understanding of global development?  This panel offers new insights on the history of globalization, via focus on dependency theory, rising consciousness about underdevelopment, and emerging international perspectives on neoliberalism. The 1970s, generally have garnered a declension narrative, yet panelists disagree with this approach and instead plot a new way forward by incorporating the global into the yet established historiographical discussion. Jensen reviews on-the-ground development through the lens of the Skills Program of Africa, created under the UN World Employment Program (WEP). It served as a pragmatic—if misdirected—formula for development.  In the early 1970s, JASPA aimed at a mandate for employment at the crux of rural development, urban employment, and manpower/womanpower procurement. Part of a failed endeavor, the WEP non-the-less led to the formation of new knowledge on the differentiation in employment by gender and region and a greater understanding of the crossover between informal and formal work. Perhaps most importantly, the WEP provided solid evidence for the prolongation of what one author called boxes…of impoverishment, heterogeneity and an economic underworld within developing nations.Stevens focuses on a group of socialists and economists working within the interdisciplinary Centro de Estudios Socioeconomicos at the University of Chile, Santiago. With varying degrees of affiliation to the Chilean Movimiento Izquierda Revolucionaria (MIR) these academics used the university as an institutional vantage point from which to mobilize a social movement to the left of Allendes Chilean road to socialism, orienting their research around themes of dependency. This collaborative research, clearly articulated in a series of notebooks and bulletins in the late 1960s, represented the most ambitious effort to empirically operationalize key elements of dependency theory, either up to that moment or since. Williams offers a reinterpretation of the move to international neoliberalism with examples from the developing world. Reeling from hyperinflation and economic mismanagement, Indonesias economy was careening toward catastrophe in the mid-1960s. A fumbled coup by the Communist Party unwittingly marked what became an embrace of the market. Suhartos authoritarian government turned to a group of University of Indonesia economists who succeeded in restoring order by instituting market reforms. Meanwhile, the efforts of the Berkeley Mafia coincided with Brazils post-coup economic reforms to unleash the Brazilian Miracle. Indonesia and Brazil embraced a market path, and they were followed by leading regional and global actors. Williams disputes traditional narratives emphasizing Milton Friedman or the Chicago Boys as the progenitors for international neoliberalism. Instead, he considers other members of a global sea change in economic thinking. </p>","On The Capitalist Periphery In The 1970s: Dependency, Underdevelopment, And The New Economic Sense Of Neoliberalism "

In assessing societal expectations and lived experiences of soldiers in war, it is necessary to consider carefully long term repercussions of black military service. These three papers offer new and different ways of analyzing black troops.  Holly Pinheiro looks closely at the martialistic rhetoric exhorting black men to join the military, noting the stark absence of appeals to black women. This differs markedly from calls to white men to enlist.  Jonathan Lande explores the impact Frederick Douglass celebration of black mens sacrifice had on postwar African American intellectuals&quot; conception of emancipation.  Lesley J.

Anchoring the physical space of the Center is an interactive digital installation, Womens Voices, which showcases a network of famous and unsung women from New Yorks history, and aims to introduce visitors to womens history in an engaging and accessible way. The scholars who worked on this innovative media piece will discuss the creative process and its research challenges, chiefly the effort to resist the hall of fame treatment, which would merely replace a pantheon of Great Men with one of Great Women. Instead, Womens Voices highlights collective movements over individuals and respects the insights of feminists such as Audre Lorde, who insisted that Without community there is no liberation. Yet the tension remains, between the desire to enlighten visitors and the need to supply them with familiar faces (those fun girls--as an early tester demanded to see). A group of public and academic historians will use the project as a point of departure to address larger questions of womens history and public history.</p>","Where Are The Fun Girls?
