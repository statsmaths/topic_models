However, just a few years later, imported Kikkoman-brand shoyu was popular enough to sustain a growing presence in major supermarket chains across California and, a few years after that, through the Midwest and into the East Coast.  This shift demanded more than just a change in tastes and shopping habits: it indicated an expanding supply chain of companies bringing the Japanese product into the United States and onto restaurant tables and pantry shelves.  The paper will trace the postwar trajectory of Kikkoman-brand soy sauce in the United States through the story of a Japanese company seeking export markets, a Japanese American entrepreneur who helped to ignite Americans’ taste for Japanese food, and retail distribution systems that placed the once-exotic item to supermarkets across the country.  However, the paper will also argue that this was not just a story of international business: it also hinged on the choices and opportunities of the thousands of Japanese and other Asian Americans who moved from ethnic enclaves into new suburbs and residential districts.  Exploring the intersections between ethnic food practices and the big business of food distribution offers new insights into the shifting racial foundations of international business practices, as they furthered both U.S. expansionism in the Pacific and Japanese economic expansionism in the United States."," Into The Suburbs: Japanese Americans, Residential Integration, And The U.s.

Harding charged that King’s denunciation of economic inequality and militarism had been obscured by the celebration of his famed I have a dream speech. This criticism has been repeated often since, particularly when conservatives such as Ronald Reagan honored a sanitized representation of King as an American hero, as opposed to a radical who had urged Americans to conquer the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism.However, closer examination of King Day’s history reveals that holiday organizers sought to recall King’s radicalism during the presidency of Bill Clinton. When the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission, led by Coretta Scott King, transformed King Day into a day of service in 1994 it looked to King’s 1968 Drum major instinct sermon for inspiration. The Commission used the sermon, in which King preached everybody can be great because everybody can serve, to encourage Americans to imitate King’s activism through acts of community service.This paper argues that civil rights movement veterans and liberals reformed King Day in order to further what Jacquelyn Dowd Hall dubbed the long civil rights movement. To persuade Congress to change the holiday, reformers such as Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) and Sen. Harris Wofford (D-PA) invoked King’s radical denunciation of economic inequality. Clinton promoted the reform - which he connected to his community service agenda - in the hope of alleviating the effects of poverty.Research in the King Commission’s little used archive, stored in the National Archives, uncovered Coretta Scott King’s correspondence and Commission meeting transcripts. These documents reveal that the Commission aimed to create a day on, not a day off, so Americans could continue the work of the civil rights movement. As a form of public history, King Day offered black and white citizens the space to commemorate King and engage with the past and the Commission sought to remember King as an activist. However, the archive and contemporary newspapers also illustrate that Dexter Scott King, Martin and Coretta's son, forced the Commission’s closure at the height of its influence. He believed that it obstructed his plan to market his father’s intellectual property.The ensuing conflict between the Commission, a government agency, and Dexter exposed tensions between the open access of public history and the limitations imposed by private claims on an historical legacy. When the King family’s agenda diverged from the Commission’s, the family’s economic interests prevailed; it became harder to mobilize Americans to participate in a day of action. Ultimately, the conflict narrowed the interpretive lens on King’s legacy, but this episode, and the Clinton era reforms, has been little analyzed by scholars. By examining the management of King’s legacy in the 1990s, this paper advances our understanding of civil rights movement history and public history. A digital visual presentation will accompany the paper and primary source materials will be available online before the conference."," A Day On, Not A Day Off: Transforming The Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday (1993–1999)"

This groundswell has most often been described through an analysis of masculinity, and indeed, white power activists organized as a paramilitary army, adopting masculine cultural forms and strict gender roles. White power activists outfitted in camouflage fatigues, trained in paramilitary camps, recruited veterans and active-duty military personnel, and obtained military-grade weapons and materiel. In this sense, white power represented an extreme variant of the paramilitary masculine culture then popular in the American mainstream.However, white power departed from paramilitary masculine culture in two important ways. First, the movement relied heavily on the supporting roles, auxiliary organizations, and social recruiting skills of women, who were often objectified by or excluded from mainstream paramilitary culture but nevertheless played important roles in unifying and sustaining white power as a social movement. Women served as potent symbols of movement ideology, brokered social relationships that cemented intergroup alliances, and worked to shape the movement from within. Second, the white power movement not only adopted paramilitary cultural forms, but also carried out a sustained course of violent action—one that created a real body count, and demands analysis and ethical engagement as something more than symbolic."," An Army For Her Husband: Women In The White Power Movement, 1975-1995"

To this day, scholars and other interested parties debate over the accuracy and fairness of Grant’s account, composed as he warded off impending death. Yet Grant had been engaged in helping to shape the narrative of Union victory and Confederate defeat from the summer of 1865, when he was composing his final report of operations, through his contributions to Century’s famed Battles and Leaders series in 1884 and early 1885. In interviews, correspondence and advice he shared his perspectives with newspaper correspondent John Russell Young, William T. Sherman, and Adam Badeau, who was busily engaged in writing what was an authorized account of Grant’s Civil War military career. Many of the themes that later appeared in the Memoirs first surfaced during such exchanges, sometimes in more detailed form, reflecting not only a discussion of what happened during the war but also how postwar politics shaped wartime recollections. In setting forth his record, Grant responded to criticisms of his performance and the emergence of other lines of argument. He proved as tenacious on the field of reminiscence as he was on the battlefield.  "," I Should Like To See Truthful History Written: Ulysses S. Grant Shapes The Union Narrative, 1865-1885"

As one of the key pieces of technology that connected industrial modernity to personal mobility the bicycle quickly became a symbol of civilizational advancement. Beginning with Englishman Thomas Stevens’ circumnavigation in 1884-1886, American, Australian, and British adventurers sought to cross the continents and world by bicycle. Viewed as feats of human strength and technological ingenuity these travels were understood within imperial and racial frameworks. At the turn-of-the-century the bicycle was embroiled within a global discourse over the suitability of colonized peoples to industry. The paper examines the published and photographic records of American, Australian, and British cycling explorers Thomas Gaskell Allen (1894), Fanny Bullock Workman (1897), Albert Lloyd (1899), and Ted Ryko (1914). It explores the complicated intersections of race, gender, and class as they travelled across the United States, Australia, and globe. The paper centres on the staged photographs of the white adventurers as they proudly display their bicycle while astonished natives look on with either puzzlement or disinterest. Cycling circumnavigators frequently made use of such images to convey a colonized peoples’ inability to ride or understand the bicycle as proof of their unfitness for self-government. In doing so the paper aims to use a benign piece of technology such as the bicycle to trace trans-imperial discussions of race and ability and interrogate empire as a process emergent in the material practices of its citizens at home and abroad."," ‘In Dwarf Land And Cannibal Country’: Race, Empire, And Bicycle Circumnavigations"

The son of a middling Virginia farmer, Samuel and his brothers migrated west in the early 1800s to make their fortune in the new state of Alabama, and by the time of his death Samuel owned more than $200,000 in cotton, land, and slaves. As a successful cotton planter in a booming Southern state, Samuel Townsend could count himself among the social and economic elite—while he lived, he’d lived the 19th century American dream. His nine children, however, occupied a social and legal status almost as far from Samuel’s as possible in the antebellum South: they were his slaves.The Townsend children—sons and daughters of a white cotton planter and several enslaved women—navigated between two families on Samuel’s plantation: the wealthy, privileged world of their father, and the extreme vulnerability of their mothers. And though Samuel emancipated his children in his will and left them the entirety of his large estate, the Townsends would continue to occupy a liminal space in American society throughout their lives as free people. Because of their inherited wealth and mixed-race ancestry, the Townsends defied easy categorization in a social hierarchy that equated African ancestry with powerlessness and inferiority—occupying a shifting space between whiteness and blackness, and social acceptance and rejection.The Townsends’ lives after their manumission in 1858 were marked by a search for belonging. In the following decades, Samuel Townsend’s sons and daughters also migrated westward, settling across Alabama, Ohio, Kansas, and Colorado. Because their racial identity was highly malleable—tied to individuals’ and communities’ differing and unstable perceptions of color and class status—the significance of the Townsends’ ‘in-betweenness’ could shift dramatically from one region, state, or neighborhood to another. Their struggles and successes provide a window into how factors such as color and geographical location impacted African American men and women’s ability to achieve social and economic mobility in the second half of the 19th century. The Townsends’ story illustrates how race relations and the very meanings of black and white could differ at fine-grained levels across the American landscape, beyond the conventional distinctions of North versus South.","All The Townsends Are Well: An American Family And The 19Th-Century Landscape Of Race"

In many of his papers, Schomburg often described his discoveries or desired acquisitions as fragments, fragmentary items or fragmentary data, and at Schomburg’s 1939 memorial, his close friend, Charles S. Johnson, also praised the then deceased Schomburg for his ability to combine these fragments into an inter-related whole. Schomburg’s very process of collecting involved the assembling of records and art objects from far-flung regions, and his personal and institutionalized archive shaped these pieces into a comprehensible gathering despite its missing parts, uneven edges, and temporal, geographical, or material differences. This process by which inconsistent diasporic fragments were assembled into an imagined whole also embodies the 135th Street branch’s early history, which housed the collection, because such a process accepted diversity, or the discursive relationships between similarities and differences, as a valued norm. This process also speaks to the connections between trained scholars and lay intellectuals who used the Schomburg Collection’s holdings including writers, artists, students, and interested community members. In particular, by relating Schomburg’s usage of fragments to Jacob Lawrence’s Migration of the Negro painting series, this paper demonstrates how the discursiveness of diasporic collecting can operate as a conceptual framework for historical recovery that also incorporates non-traditional forms of history into African American historiography.","An Inter-Related Whole: Understanding The Fragments, Frameworks, And Framed Works In The Arthur Schomburg Collection"

Public employment tripled in the quarter century after World War II, more than double the rate of increase in the private sector workforce. While the baby boom-fueled expansion of education was the most important driver of this growth, the shift also reflected growing demand for streets, sewers, and social and protective services. Despite John Kenneth Galbraith’s famous lament about poverty of public goods, the postwar era saw unprecedented investment in the public sector. The growth of the welfare state created employment opportunities for millions of women, but these opportunities were conscribed in crucial ways by prevailing norms about the transient, supplementary nature of feminized work. Challenging these notions, millions of government women formed and joined labor unions during the three decades after World War II. Initially concentrated on professional and service work, in the second half of the 1970s organizing efforts increasingly shifted to the millions of clerical workers in government.This paper will explore those efforts through a case study of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). Faced with fiscal austerity and budget cuts, AFSCME women used both unions and the law to challenge reigning norms about the ease and simplicity of office work. By demanding that their labor be compensated on the basis of its complexity, difficulty, and responsibility rather than the prevailing rates in private industry, these women challenged the emerging neoliberal consensus about the sanctity of the market.

In fleeing oppressive environments, fugitive slaves used holistic, environmental techniques to evade bloodhounds that were trained to perpetrate racial violence against their bodies. While recent scholarship divulges information on these unique animals and their position in slave societies throughout the Caribbean and US South, we still know very little of how these dogs were conditioned to sense race and the many ways black fugitives used environmental knowledge to evade their nonhuman pursuers. An Atlantic network of breeding, training, and sales facilitated the use of slave hounds to subdue human property, actualize legal categories of subjugation, and build efficient economic and state regimes. Drawing upon plantation journals, ex-slave testimonies, and published travel narratives I show that canines were an integral part in facilitating slavery’s expansion and intimidating laborers. As dogs proliferated Atlantic slave societies in the late-eighteenth century, slave hunting was professionalized shortly after. However, black fugitives adapted to their environments using a variety of physical techniques and metaphysical concepts, reimagining spiritual ideas, agricultural innovations, and holistic remedies to survive American bondage and prevent canine brutality. Slaves easily outran their human trackers, but knew specialized knowledge was required to subvert the canine’s heightened olfactory senses and secure their escape. My paper examines this specialized knowledge, and argues that integrating canines into the environmental history of American slavery provides unique approaches to analyzing violence, resistance, and domination.","Erasing The Scent: Canines And Slaves In The Slave South"

As the panel abstract notes, part of the appeal of a close examination of Florida's history is that so many larger stories intersect there: the earliest evidence of humans in the Southeast, the violent birth of Spanish Florida in the Atlantic World and various imperial struggles, the United States' rise as a nation and the seizure of the peninsula and subsequent attempt to erase Native people and romanticize their past, and the persistence of those indigenous peoples. While William Bartram was a relative latecomer to Florida and certainly an outsider, he fell in love with the place immediately upon visiting it with his father, botanist John Bartram, in 1765. For the younger Bartram, Florida held vast natural beauty and the potential for prosperity as well. He attempted to start a plantation there, but this dream fell apart quickly, and he returned to Philadelphia in 1766. He revisited Florida on the eve of the American War for Independence as part of the journey that would eventually lead to his masterpiece, The Travels. Bartram's Travels contain a wealth of information about Native Florida in the late eighteenth century, but Bartram also used Florida to advocate intercultural respect and explain the deep history that anchored Native people in the region from \"the most distant antiquity.\"","Every Sign Or Mark Of The Most Distant Antiquity: William Bartram's Florida And Native History"

Hamelin was not alone in her disavowal.  Chroniclers of Detroit history from Frances Parkman to Henry Ford doubted the veracity of French oral histories and labelled their narrators unreliable.  The histories discounted by Hamelin, Parkman, and Ford, however, can be viewed instead as artifacts of community cohesion.  This presentation will consider a hybrid song composed of French and indigenous lyrics and recorded in the early nineteenth century that has survived to the present day.  Music and song have been a prevalent and powerful medium of cultural transmission in Great Lakes French communities.  Dramatizing a set of practices in song can take the state of being on which these practices rest out of the realm of the everyday and either enshrine it as an integral part of the self’s connection to a community, or relegate it to the margins, until the meaning of its constituent parts becomes lost, but perhaps only temporarily.  This presentation is a call for reclamation of community through reconsideration of hybrid songs that mark the rich shared culture between the French and indigenous nations.  The presenter will sing the song in question and discuss the musical tradition of French Detroit.  The song continues to resonate and singing it has created new contexts for understanding the history of the region’s French community.","Fait Chorus : Reclaiming Displaced Histories Through Song"

This alteration was brought about in part by an influx of a young educated work force that fled the North in search of warmer climates and greater economic opportunities.  Bringing with them a white suburban political mindset, these transplants sought a governor who reflected their own ideology.  They found their champion in Claude Kirk, a successful businessman and political outsider who in 1966 became the first Republican governor elected in Florida since Reconstruction.  By playing the role of political outsider and providing plans to run the state like a business, Kirk found support from a frustrated public who viewed the entrenched Democratic political establishment in Florida as detrimental to the growth of the state.  Moreover, Kirk’s use of thinly veiled racialized law and order rhetoric played well to a white public who wanted to maintain their control but recognized that overt racism would be disadvantageous to the state’s economy.  This paper seeks to add new insight into to the rise of modern conservatism by placing Kirk and Florida in the center of this political shift.  Moreover, it will examine Kirk’s status as a political outsider to illustrate how modern conservatism has focused on a rejection of establishment politics and often embraced businessmen who sought to run the government as a business.

However, the war exacted a deep social cost from those who fought and survived it. We have learned—from scholars such as Eric T. Dean, Jr., James Marten, Jeffrey McClurken, and Diane Miller Sommerville—that thousands of Civil War veterans came home damaged from their experience as soldiers. Their postwar lives were marked by alcoholism, fits of rage, violence, and depression. The most unhinged of these veterans were committed to state insane asylums for rehabilitation or custody. This story is becoming increasingly—if not disturbingly—familiar as more research comes out on Civil War veterans. But lost in this story, are the beliefs of the veterans themselves. This paper explores the contrasting beliefs of veterans and aylum doctors regarding the cause of mental illness among Civil War veterans. Asylum physicians argued that mental illness resulted from clinical conditions, such as chronic mania, which could result from poor moral decisions. Civil War veterans, however, believed and argued that the mental illness that afflicted their comrades, were the result of a vague condition they called played out or broken down. These terms were broad and were meant to convey the multiple physical and mental stressors of the war. These terms organically spread among veterans as a soldiers explanation for mental illness. This could insulate them from shame and later helped them win pensions in the postwar years. ","Played Out: Veterans' Interpretations Of Mental Illness "

In addition, anarchists in Florida played important roles in the Caribbean, including the Cuban War for Independence in the 1890s, the early years of anarchist organization in Cuba after the U.S. occupation of the island ended in 1902, and in labor conflicts impacting the tobacco industry in the region.

Of those at least 13 involved men of color.  Eloping with the coachman was called a mania and a craze because of its seeming ubiquity. Headlines abounded such as, \"Still Another Heiress Marries a Coachman...\" and \"Another Coachman Favored.\" The sensationalism of the coachman/heiress pairing entered the realm of pop culture through songs and cartoons.  The newspaper stories relished in the scandal, especially the interracial pairings.  Many thought this was post-emancipation America’s chickens coming home to roost.  Yet perhaps surprisingly, a number of newspaper articles seemed to sanction the relationships.  While some outlets framed the interracial relationships as freaks of nature, others told the stories as charming modern love tales, even though it was decades before interracial marriage was legal nationwide.  One couple got around the legal barrier by having the white heiress paint her face with dark make-up so that the minister thought the couple was African American rather than just the groom.  Yet newspapers did act as warning signals to eloping couples that the women’s fathers or brothers sometimes had made threats, through the conduit of the newspaper reporter, that they planned to shoot the groom on sight.  Rarely did such violence occur, but the medium of the newspaper served as both celebrant of newly minted couples and a mouthpiece about the scandal they had unleashed on their innocent and unsuspecting families.","The Coachman Is At It Again: Heiress Elopement Scandals With Coachmen In The Gilded Age"

The split came after a long dispute over the relationship between folklore and science, the role of social science in democratic society, and the importance of professionalization in the production of knowledge. Over the objections of anthropologist Franz Boas and the American Folklore Society, the upstart Texans, led by University of Texas professor J. Frank Dobie, insisted that the unique value of folklore lay in its ability to challenge prevailing cultural and institutional assumptions about science, society professionalization, and modernization. Dobie believed that folklore studies was an art wherein the subject, the storyteller, and the audience all participated in enacting a tradition; Boas feared that this violated the standards of objective science so important to the social utility of the scholar’s work. Above all, the Texas Folklore Society represent the view that social science-- particularly folklore-- could be used to enchant and mystify, rather than categorize and clarify, the world. This paper reconstructs the Texas-national dispute, using records of the National Folklore Society and the papers of J. Frank Dobie. With this story, I aim to excavate a dissenting discourse of social science that elevated imagination and enchantment over professionalization and standardization.","There Ain't No Texas Branch: Science And Imagination In The American Folklore Society"

Operating under the control of the State Department but with close ties to the National Security Council, the Office of Public Diplomacy worked to influence public opinion in favor of the United States intervention in Central America through white propaganda distributed in the U.S. media and in academic and policymaking circles. Drawing on recently declassified U.S. government documents, archival collections of former U.S. policymakers, as well as archival research in Nicaragua, I argue that the Office of Public Diplomacy exemplified the Reagan Administration’s embrace of human rights rhetoric, centering on democracy promotion, to justify U.S. interventionism in Central America. Specifically, the administration energetically utilized the lexicon of human rights to portray U.S.-funded counterrevolutionary forces seeking to destabilize the leftist government of Nicaragua as anti-communist democrats, despite evidence of widespread human rights abuses. Correspondingly, the Reagan Administration worked to delegitimize the social and economic human rights initiatives of the Nicaraguan revolutionary government. The Office of Public Diplomacy played a signal role in both projects, and I contend that over the course of the decade it contributed to the emergence of a distinctive form of U.S. political and economic interventionism during the Reagan era, with significant implications for post-Cold War international relations.","'We Were Telling The Truth About Central America': The Office Of Public Diplomacy And The Reagan Administration's Low-Intensity War On Nicaragua"

José Agustín Quintero, a poet-journalist refugee from the 1848 López conspiracy in Cuba, had come under the influence of former Texas president Mirabeau Lamar and emerged an ardent Southern nationalist. The guns of secession found Quintero assigned as confidential commissioner to the Mexican border with Texas. A site of Confederate cotton trade, desperados and caudillo fortunes, there Quintero adroitly entreated with the local fiefdom of Santiago Vidaurri, governor of the Mexican states of Nuevo León and Coahuila. As the war progressed, Quintero would successfully represent the Confederacy with the imperiled President Juárez and the forces of a usurping Emperor Maximilian. Part of Quintero’s success lay with his network of exiled Cubans located in Mexico, such as Pedro Santacilia, private secretary and son-in-law to President Benito Juárez. At the same time, Quintero’s literary aspirations provided opportunities to cement strong relationships in Mexico, such as with Mexico’s national poet, Guillermo Prieto, who also served Juárez as minister of finance. To this succession of Mexican authorities Quintero delivered taxable Confederate cotton trade when the Lincoln administration promised loans that never arrived. Such lucrative trade helped sustain the Juárez government as it sought to elude the grasp of Maximilian’s forces; however, at the same time, it also ensured the survival of the Trans-Mississippi Department as a virtually separate Confederate nation after Vicksburg.

This paper aims at analyzing his persona and political thought and leadership style in the broader Greater Caribbean. This transnational region encompasses the Caribbean Sea islands and countries as well as part of the South US. I will argue that similar historical, political, economic, and social dynamics of the 1920s in that region promoted the rise of comparable politicians, such as Gerardo Machado in Cuba or Rafael Leónidas Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. These politicians found similar solutions to problems their respective societies were experiencing by developing impressive public works programs, improving education and sanitation, and inspiring a strong cult of personality, at the same time they gathered unprecedented power in their hands. This new perspective will allow us to better comprehend the rise of Huey Long, to debunk the stereotypical idea of American exceptionalism, and to focus on the connections rather than the differences between north and south America or Anglo and Latin America.","A Greater Caribbean Caudillo: A New Look Upon The Kingfish Of Louisiana"

Advocates against sexual assault have used Title IX as a powerful lever to force administrations to address rape. As a result, universities and colleges have developed significant orientation and training programs on consent to prevent sexual assault.  This discussion, both in the media and higher education, has proceeded with a presumption that the attention to consent has only recently arisen within college administrations and student affairs programming. This paper argues that questions of consent and their correlations with sexual assault have a much longer history in higher education which stretches back to the turn of the 20th century. Higher education historians have catalogued significantly the development of sex education and the influence of the sexual revolution on college campuses. However, little research has considered how the academy taught college women and men to regard consent, and how coeducational institutions dealt with sexual assault on campuses before Title IX.   The efforts regarding consent have gone unnoticed because, as Margaret Nash has argued, the entire field of the history of higher education posits a progressive trajectory of increasingly democratized access, which centers around men and the male norm in higher educational institutions.  This historical discursive treatment has eclipsed the pre-Title IX practices which evolved out of academic women’s work on the female side of the sex-segregated academy. One reason for this is that women’s work on consent developed in the area of student affairs—which has only recently been recognized as a development by women for women college students. In reality, deans of men (who later became deans of students) appropriated from women the student affairs profession in the middle of the 20th century, and this caused much of the women’s work regarding feminism and social justice to be forgotten.  Compounding this, the work regarding consent and sexual assault resided within the discourse of safety which has long been used to produce and maintain traditional gender roles, and which actively limited women’s access to the full academy that men enjoyed.  These factors have caused historians to overlook feminist activity regarding sexual assault within the sex-segregated academy.This paper details the known parameters of the history of consent before Title IX as it arose on college campuses through student affairs. It considers the development of the safety discourse, and the ways in which this constrained and enabled an intergenerational partnership between academic women and female students to develop protections against sexual assault, and to educate women regarding consent and heterosexuality. The material is derived from primary sources in the records of the National Association for Women in Education, the Intercollegiate Association of Women Students, fraternity publications, and student affairs records at majority and historically black coeducational universities. It also considers the links between female administrators and the development of women’s physical education, the Young Women’s Christian Association, and women’s student government.","A History Of Consent"

Their main cause of action was the failed ratification of eighteen treaties the United States made with California Indians in 1851 and 1852.  Bringing the undelivered promises of the treaties back under public scrutiny a half-century later, reformers successfully lobbied Congress to authorize the state of California to sue the United States on behalf of the Indians of California, a class entitled to equitable compensation for undelivered treaty promises.  What many hoped would be, as one intertribal Indian organization put it, a just and final disposal of the California Indian problem, became a foundation of the revived governance of a California Indian Country that included many more Indian tribes, reservations, and people than the treaties ever acknowledged.  This paper considers the politics of Indian policy reform in California.  It begins with the question of how treaties that were never ratified became the focus of a public debate about the state’s Indian history.  It will also consider where historically minded non-Indian reformers’ ideas of justice intersected with and diverged from Indians’ conceptions of their history in post-statehood California.  Indians regularly focused their political action on the problem of how to acquire land.  In examining how forms of historical interpretation of the nineteenth century shaped and delimited Indian rights claims in the early twentieth century, this paper will assess the possibilities for, and constraints on, Indian political action in the twentieth century.","A Just And Final Disposal: The History And Politics Of California Indian Land Before The Indian New Deal"

This paper examines soldiers’ letters, diaries, and memoirs, as well as the papers of the Army and welfare organizations to place the feelings of millions of soldiers in the American Expeditionary Force and thousands of women serving in welfare roles on equal footing with the goals of the Army, YMCA, and other welfare agencies.  Although Army officials demanded rigorous physical training from new recruits and YMCA workers encouraged soldier participation in tournaments like the A.E.F. and Inter-Allied Games, individual doughboys batted baseballs behind the trenches in informal games and cheered in stadiums as audiences more than 30,000 strong.  Soldiers and welfare workers therefore made personal choices on whether to engage with athletics informally or as part of a program, locally or as part of a mass, and as a participant or a spectator, important decisions that mirrored the those Americans made every day both in the United States and over there.  By jointly examining personal and institutional perspectives on sports during the First World War historians can illustrate how both individuals and institutions shaped the development of American athletic culture and more accurately describe the American society they returned home to as veterans.

African Americans in Hannibal Square, the black historic district in Winter Park, were part of a wider black social world that wove together economic, social, and political activism that linked to community such as Eatonville (the first incorporated black town in the U.S.).  Key to success and failure for this community was the ability for citizens to tell the story of their community to the wider world.

Harris wrote in her formal charge of discrimination to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).  In its investigation into Harris’s charge, the EEOC determined that she was indeed a victim of race and sex discrimination and Sears had violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  Yet it declined to include her case, and others like it, in its sex discrimination lawsuit or race discrimination lawsuits against Sears in 1979.  As a result, these cases grappled primarily with offenses against white women and African American men.  But what about black women’s grievances?  My paper considers the Sears cases and their implications for black working women.  It argues that African American women workers engaged government and corporate programs to advance fair employment and affirmative action policies and propel them into the middle class.  However, they soon learned that neither the government nor Sears (nor the retail industry, generally) would be effective allies in meeting this end, compelling black women to pursue other avenues.  These entities were unable, or perhaps unwilling, to understand the five-decade movement to integrate department-store work and consumption – an endeavor for and by African Americans, most often led by its female members – or recognize the intersectionality of black women’s oppression.

In speeches, political tracts, and novels, white and African American suffragists challenged denigrating stereotypes of old women as foolish, isolated, and irrelevant, while promoting female aging as a source of wisdom essential to national progress.  By staging grand celebrations of aging leaders, they designed forms of political protest that emphasized seniority as a qualification for leadership and promoted modern day \"matriarchs\" as the protectors of women and children.  The effort to redefine grandmothers and spinsters as political leaders crossed the color line, but was not without racial tension.  White suffragists emphasized the education and wealth of prominent Anglo Saxon elders, while black suffragists sought respect for the folk wisdom and survival skills of aging freedwomen.  Both white and black elders faced a backlash at the turn of the twentieth century as activists equated liberation with the spirit of youth—a theme addressed by Miya Carey on this panel—and age prejudice against older women intensified—as Vanessa May will explain in her paper.  As the recent Presidential election demonstrated, women running for political office still contend with negative attitudes towards old women.  Recovering the significance of age in the woman suffrage movement will both enrich the narrative forms through which we understand history and, perhaps, equip us to better understand persistent obstacles to women's empowerment.","Aging And Woman Suffrage, From The Biographical To The Political: Reconsidering The Historical Genres Through Which We Understand The Significance Of Age In American History"

Before Henry Clay’s well-known speech, the former Treasury secretary established a network that extended from New York City’s learned societies to local clergymen and philanthropic associations to regional contacts and locally prominent men. He then mobilized newspapers and the post office to disseminate an argument against the war—based on its cost and its dubious justification—even in the West. The details of this effort and its reception across the country are recorded in a remarkable scrapbook. A concern with bellicose expansionism directed against neighbors was deeply rooted in Gallatin's Genevan heritage and he doubted that the union could encompass territories stretching to the Pacific. Yet, what he considered an unjust war also promised a windfall of ethnological knowledge concerning the possibility of indigenous social development (e.g. Pueblo peoples). Building on work on antebellum voluntary associations, print culture, and communication networks (e.g. Johann Neem, David Henkin, Richard Johns); the place of public finance in politics (e.g. Robin Einhorn, Max Edling); and opposition to the U.S.-Mexican War (Robert Johansson, Amy Greenberg), this paper argues that Gallatin's efforts reveal the complementary roles of learned societies and religious organizations in allowing prominent men to parlay wealth, reputation, and local weight into national influence in a representative democracy through the public sphere. It also suggests a broader reevaluation of opposition to the U.S.-Mexican War.   ","Albert Gallatin And The Mobilization Of Opposition To The U.s.-Mexican War"

A baton mishap by the favored Australians provided an opening for the unheralded American quartet of three black young women, Mae Faggs, Barbara Jones, and Catherine Hardy, and one white young woman, Janet Moreau. But the U.S. did not claim victory solely due to Australia’s misfortune; the interracial foursome earned their victory, as evidenced by the fact that they set a new world record in route to gold.  In the context of the sporting Cold War, which recently had ignited due to the re-entry of the Soviet Union in the Olympic Games, the U.S. women’s relay triumph presumably should have inspired much praise.  However, the white and black U.S. sport presses proved unimpressed by the unexpected gold.  After offering muted compliments, both white and black sportswriters primarily used the women’s relay victory to offer continued criticism of U.S. women’s track, emphasizing their lack of talent and ability. Although curious, the demands and conditions of the Cold War explain this response.  With the Soviet Union’s participation in the 1952 Games, U.S. sport officials, along with white and black sport media, considered the Games an opportunity to present a pluralistic vision of American masculinity, with white and black male athletes cooperating to win victory. Yet voices of athletic authority proved uncertain as to what an interracial cohort of female track athletes communicated about the nation.  Ahead of the Olympics, sportswriters of both races emphasized the youth of the women’s track team, suggesting victories would remain elusive for the inexperienced American squad. While the team did feature nine female athletes under age twenty, the attention to age served larger ideological purposes, allowing male sport commentators to avoid reckoning with these young women as athletes who potentially troubled prevailing expectations of gender, race, and athleticism.  In white sport culture, attention to the youthfulness of female track athletes implicitly positioned sport as a temporary endeavor, thereby not threatening the insistence on the inherent femininity of white American women.  The focus on youth served a similar purpose in black sport culture.  As part of the broader effort for African American rights, black sport writers prioritized the achievements of black male athletes, with youthfulness of black female athletes accentuating the masculine capacity of black male athletes. The U.S. women’s relay victory in Helsinki thus disrupted the ideological equations established by white and black sport cultures.  In reaction, sportswriters emphasized the lack of success attained by U.S. women, lamenting the fact that they scored no other victories.  The shifting estimations of U.S. women’s track provides a perspective of the ideological operation of age, gender, race, and sport at the outset of the sporting Cold War.  A comparative analysis of the coverage of women’s track before and after the 1952 Games illuminates how the athletic success by women challenged expectations of gender, race, and athleticism in white and black sport cultures.

In Part I, he discussed at great length the European presence in Africa, highlighting the achievements of explorers and the intrepidness of King Leopold II of Belgium in establishing a commercial presence in the Congo. He argued that European interest in Africa was purely economic, contending that Europeans saw the continent not as a land to civilize or explore, but rather as a place to be occupied. He predicted that European colonization would follow the establishment of trade relations in Africa, making explicit comparisons between the colonization of the Americas in the early modern period and the situation in Africa. He warned that the Africa of adventure would become the Africa of occupation in the hands of Europeans and suggested that the United States could offer Africa an alternative to European imperialist subjugation. This paper contextualizes Haven’s work in Gilded Age images of Africa and explores how ideas about progress, modernity, race and civilization undergird Haven’s image of Africa. Haven called for the Americanizing of Africa and linked this to the Negro Problem/Negro Question in the United States.  How did Haven use the American colonial past to frame arguments for new American colonization projects in Africa? Why did Haven and other Americans call for stabilizing Liberia and expanding the US presence in Africa as a democratic, anti-imperial model for governance?","America In Africa: Gilbert Haven And Gilded Age Images Of A United States Of Africa"

Native Americans’ ideas about and practices of citizenship were shaped by the passage of the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act, which granted them U.S. citizenship whether they wanted it or not, and the economic and environmental exigencies of the 1930s.  During the so-called Indian New Deal (1933-1945), federal policy-makers promoted new American Indian political structures to assimilate Indian people into the national political economy, but did so by allowing for voluntary elections on tribal constitutions and charters of incorporation.  American Indians’ debates on these political changes reveal the bitter legacies of colonialism and the promises of renewed indigenous governance.  Native American politicians’ and citizens’ reimagining of reservation space during the 1930s via new legal instruments and conservation measures became an important means to protect Indianness on Indians’ terms and contest assimilation.  The paper will address the ways in which American Indians wrestled with the politics and policies of the New Deal era to assert their particular vision of citizenship.  As a historian of twentieth century American Indian political and environmental history who has situated that history in an international context, most recently in a 2009 book (Serving Their Country: American Indian Patriotism and Politics in the Twentieth Century, Harvard University Press) and a 2013 journal article (‘Modern America Desperately Needs to Listen’: The Emerging Indian in an Age of Environmental Crisis, The Journal of American History), I welcome this opportunity to discuss with fellow scholars of the New Deal era and of American citizenship more broadly a core element of my new book project, tentatively entitled Citizens of the World: A History of Native American Citizenship (under contract with Cambridge Univ.

We lack an equivalent practice in history and prioritize sources that we interact with mainly as readers, observers, and listeners: documents, visual materials, and oral histories. The experiential in the discipline of history seems more common as a mode of presentation, not analysis, and occurs most often at public history sites as reenactors and museum interpreters in costume demonstrate what the past was like. In the case of soap, I have questions that could be answered by doing. Does tallow (throughout history one of soap's main ingredients) smell? How dangerous was it make lye from ashes? How hard exactly was the crown soap that Benjamin Franklin boasted of to acquaintances? (He came from a family of Boston soap boilers.) Specifically, my presentation will discuss three kinds of experiential history I am employing in my research: fieldwork to fields and factories where the oils that make soap are produced, an amateur chemistry set so that I can understand the chemical processes that transformed soapmaking in the 19th century, and manufacturing my own soap using historic recipes.","An Experiential History Of Soap"

While the death toll alone is staggering, the number of wounded soldiers left altered for life is far worse. In the post-war period, the medical and social perceptions of insanity did not change drastically. Instead, society and the government distributed aid and support based on the same foundation of physical and moral causation as during the war. As a result of these continued perceptions of insanity, veterans’ organizations and commemorations served as a coping mechanism in addition to the political and social purposes already studied by historians. At the same time that veterans’ organizations, such as the Grand Army of the Republic, acted to commemorate their participation in the war and push for veterans’ benefits in the post-war period, these groups also provided veterans support systems that helped those struggling to survive and those struggling with their wartime experiences. Just as during the war, veterans used networks of comrades and reunions to cope with wartime experiences in the post-war period. This paper will examine how veterans used organizations such as the Grand Army of the Republic as primarily a coping mechanism in the post-war period. Built as a fraternal organization, the GAR served first as a support organization for veterans, a space for veterans to gather with others who understood their experiences and worked together to support those struggling after the war.","An Organization Of Brothers: The Grand Army Of The Republic, Civil War Veterans, And Coping With War"

These lessons often derived from the Munich Conference of 1938 and the failure to prevent a Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. But other uses of history within the Johnson administration in relation to wartime policy have gone unaddressed. In particular, how the intelligence community used history to formulate estimates of Hanoi’s future behavior has been all but ignored. Using recently-declassified documents to examine this question reveals much about how top Johnson administration officials used different forms of history to help form arguments for their preferred policies.Throughout the Vietnam War, the intelligence community could not break enemy communication codes and never managed to cultivate high-level human sources in Hanoi. As such, using history was one of the primary methods by which the intelligence agencies sought to understand their enemy. Unlike policymakers who used historical analogies drawn from World War II or Korea, the intelligence agencies examined the Hanoi government’s behavior during the First Indochina War and the subsequent peace talks. Doing so led to much more accurate appraisals of potential enemy actions. Yet most policymakers ignored these reports. Instead, they favored appraisals drawing from World War II and Korea that confirmed their preconceived notions on Vietnam. Analogies that spoke to individual policymakers’ personal experiences often prevailed over specific examples drawn from Hanoi’s previous actions. Thus, much accurate intelligence went ignored.","Analogical Peril: Intelligence, History, And Policy In The Vietnam War"

Stassen’s election would be unremarkable—his positions on most major issues were similar to Wendell Wilkie and Earl Warren—except for the intensely anti-Semitic character of the campaign. Ray P. Chase, a Republican stalwart in the state, waged an anti-Semitic smear campaign against the incumbent Farmer-Labor candidate, Elmer Benson, who was seen as too close to Jewish interests in Minnesota.  Chase, a former GOP congressman, had close connections to the Minneapolis business community and to prominent figures on the far right on the national stage, including William Pelley and Gerald L.K.

The proceeds of this sale were essential to underwriting the financial stability of the small school that would grow into Georgetown University. The first mention of Jesuits owning slaves appears in the historical record in 1717. Caught in the compromising political climate that threatened their ability to practice their Roman Catholic faith, the Jesuits hunkered down in rural Maryland to support their religious work through farming, first with the help of indentured servants and then with the labor of enslaved persons, many of whom they inherited or received as gifts from wealthy lay persons in the area. The number of slaves owned by the Maryland Province Jesuits grew dramatically—to 192 persons in 1765 and then to 272 persons by 1838, many of whom were children or those past the age of fruitful labor in 1838 when the men decided to rid themselves of their slaves, wholesale. While much historical work has been written on the Jesuits and slavery, that writing has primarily focused on the moral universe in which these religious men made their decisions about slaveholding. Thus far, however, no scholar has studied the enslaved people themselves. Therefore, my paper will focus first on the lives and experiences of the enslaved, rather than on their Jesuit owners. Beginning in 1717, I will note every subsequent appearance of an enslaved person associated with the Jesuit community as I revisit the sources that slowly reveal the conditions under which these individuals labored and lived. With an eye to the events and relationships that made up the daily lives of this enslaved community, I will work to identify each enslaved person and to situate them within their families and larger community. Using digital analysis and presentation methods, I will build up a network of biographical and relational linked open data about them to answer several key questions: •How did these individuals come to be enslaved and to be owned by the Jesuits? •What were the material conditions of their lives? •How were their families created and sustained?•How were the young and elderly treated? My work will help scholars of slavery to understand more deeply the characteristics of slavery in the Chesapeake. Also, the work will allow me to ask, in a twist on William Thomas and Edward Ayers’ phrase, what difference did Catholicism make? Prescriptions about not separating families and ensuring that enslaved persons could practice their religion dot the historical records in which the Jesuits discuss their obligations as slaveholders. But, until these statements are reconciled to the actual historical conditions and the circumstances of enslaved persons throughout the region, we cannot fully evaluate how these people’s experiences of slavery differed from others in the Chesapeake.","As Justice And Charity Demands:  An Examination Of The Enslaved Persons Owned (And Sold) By The Maryland Province Jesuits, 1717-1838"
"<h5><i>Professor Leslie Paris (University of British Columbia)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2018-04-14</h5><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 10:00 to 11:30</h5><p><h5><b>Id:</b> 2641</h5><p>At the height of the baby boom in the mid-1950s, a small number of American women, mainly white and middle-class, became anti-establishment activists. Against the era’s received wisdom, they encouraged one another to live more naturally: to give birth without drugs (and sometimes at home) in order to experience this rite of passage more fully; to room with and breastfeed their babies to encourage attachment; to sew their own baby carriers so as to keep their babies close and contented; to sprout alfalfa seeds and make their own homemade yogurt for better health. By the late 1960s, in the wake of a broader counterculture’s skepticism about traditional figures of authority, this movement entered the mainstream, and it has remained an influential force in parenting (and particularly in mothering) ever since. My paper traces this parental counterculture from its emergence in the postwar era to the early twenty-first century, considering its rising influence at a time of widening skepticism about traditional authority and exploring some of its offshoots in more recent years, from the influence of Dr. William Sears’ attachment parenting from the 1980s onward to recent debates about extended breastfeeding. Based on extensive archival research, this paper considers natural parenting as a lens through which to situate the longer trajectory of the counterculture; explores modern (and nostalgic) constructions of the natural; and examines how women have wielded the banner of natural parenting toward communal, political, and business ends.  Natural parenting has been the source of significant commentary, if less often by historians than by journalists. While some have termed these efforts emancipatory, others have criticized them as anti-feminist or regressive. For instance, even as the La Leche League (an organization founded by women to support other women in breastfeeding) grew rapidly in the 1960s, many working mothers found the group’s insistence on mothers staying home with their babies both unrealistic and guilt-inducing. An era of greater consumer choice in parenting, made possible in part by the counterculture, led to empowerment for some (particularly for better-off women, some of whom argued that their strategic removal from the paid workforce was morally valuable); it also led to anxiety about doing the right thing once that thing was less well-defined. American parents have disagreed about how baby-led they should be, and have had variable access to economic opportunity. Yet the natural parenting movement today is more diverse than ever, and cuts across distinctions of religion, region, race and class in ways that its media depiction would appear to underreport. My paper considers how women themselves have represented the natural parenting movement to one another. Using an archive of online message boards and blogs focusing on natural parenting, as well as more traditional archival sources, I explore how women communicated about the natural and the authentic; how they built businesses (including companies that made baby carriers or cloth diapers) to support their beliefs; and how they reached out to other women, both to educate others and to promote their own interests.

To what did Augusta, a city of 10,000, owe this distinction? The answer was its booming publishing trade. Home to E.C. Allen & Company, Vickery & Hill, and others, Augusta was the source of millions of cheap periodicals dispatched across North America each month and the indisputable capital of the United States’ mail-order-magazine trade. This idiosyncratic industry fell somewhere between the worlds of Richard Sears and Cyrus Curtis, yet differed greatly from them in ways that complicate our understanding of how industrially-produced culture fit into a nascent consumer society. For Allen and his peers, the goal was not to sell subscriptions or even advertising space, but to recruit direct-sales agents who could be persuaded to purchase bulk lots of cheap goods – lithographs, telescopes, photograph albums, and other items – imported from abroad. Along with these premiums, Augusta’s publishers were prodigious importers of paper, ink, envelopes, and other key commodities – perhaps the most important of which were the mailing lists they used to find those Americans most likely to succumb to their appeals. The payoff was a steady stream of coins, money-orders, postage stamps, and other makeshift forms of payment that made their way to Augusta each day. This nexus of junk mail, cookie-cutter magazines, cheap goods, and small payments produced a kind of mass-culture boom town that by century’s end had run its course.

Sponsoring Kiram as a special international student was part of a larger colonial experiment aimed to train her to become a leader and broker of civilization in her Moro [Muslim] Filipino community. The experiment tried to carefully manage her tutelage in the United States so that she would be Americanized just enough so as to lift her out of the so-called barbarism of cultural practices like polygamy and yet retain enough of her cultural background as a Moro to maintain a connection to her community. This presentation investigates the kinds of techniques executed in the colonial experiment on Kiram. It looks at how a range of seemingly disparate elements like chaperonage, curriculum, grading, spending allowance, leisure, modes of dress and adornment were weaponized as forms of surveillance and management. It also analyzes how American public created a sensationalized form of surveillance that sought to measure the colonial experiment’s success and failure through observations of Tarhata’s changing physical and sartorial aesthetics.","Balancing Cultures In Colonial Experiments: Tarhata Kiram And Disciplining Muslim Filipino Identities"

Yet this is highly problematic, as basketry is the keeper of stories, it displays intimate connections to land, Indigenous epistemologies, complex skill, and can be read as her-story throughout time.  Because basketry is a gendered labor, women are placed at the center of this record. Women are often left out of the historical record in California, yet through basketry we can resurface these voices, look at how Native women used them in a multitude of ways for example as legal documents, or literature, fashion, spirituality, etc.  These baskets are rooted in land specific territories, their designs originate from landscapes, and this knowledge is passed down from generations.

One of the few survivors of the voyage, Zammouri served as a translator, healer, guide, and scout, and was reportedly killed by Zuni Indians in what is now New Mexico.  Arab Americans and African Americans both lay claim to Zammouri’s legacy to emphasize their contributions to discovery and conquest, and ultimately to claim inclusion inclusion.  For the Zuni, by stark contrast, Zammouri was a harbinger of conquest and colonial violence, and is memorialized as Chakwaina, the black monster kachina.  From the Native perspective, whether a White European or an enslaved Moroccan, Zammouri represents the beginning of a long and violent history of colonization that continues to the present day.  For Arab and African Americans, Zammouri’s position as a Black/African/Arab/Muslim/Slave and non-European is essential to the story.  These opposing narratives speak to issues of race, power, and colonialism then and now.  Zammouri’s changing racial identity illuminates Arab American racialization and racial in-betweenness; if early twentieth-century Syrian Americans were positioned somewhere between Arab and White, today, Arab Americans have drifted demonstrably toward the dark end of the racial spectrum.","Between Arab And Black: Zammouri, Race, And Arab American Identity"

Consequently, the historiography obscures the roles of adolescent black girls, particularly those who were not on what is deemed to be the front lines of the movement. I contend that looking beyond classrooms and marches expands our definition of civil rights activism, and reveals the various, and lesser-known, ways that black girls engaged with the movement. Histories that examine alternative frontiers of civil rights activism, such as recreation, focus primarily on heterosocial spaces, and do not employ age as a category of analysis. In contrast, I focus on two single-sex organizations and their programs for adolescent girls: the National Association of Colored Girls’ 1960 Citizenship Institute for Future Leaders and the National Council of Negro Women’s 1965 International Debutante Cotillion. How did membership in an organization facilitate black girls’ abilities to participate in social movements and provide a platform for them to discuss their ideas? In what ways did black girls symbolize the fulfillment of civil rights? The Institute educated young black women about government and citizenship, but also emboldened and provided a platform for them to articulate their thoughts about civil rights protest, and make claims for economic justice. Debutantes from around the world gathered at the International Debutante Cotillion to symbolize the promise of integration and democracy at home and abroad. My objective is to interrogate the intersections of age and gender in order to expand our understanding of civil rights activism.

Branded as \"The Town that Freedom Built\" and marketed to heritage tourists as the \"Oldest Incorporated African American Municipality in America,\" Eatonville has inspired generations seeking refuge from despairing tales of life in the Jim Crow South at \"the Nadir\" of race relations in America. The town's longstanding narrative, rooted in late 19th century promotional literature and popularized by the autobiographical works of Zora Neale Hurston, exaggerates and romanticizes separatism while ignoring Eatonville's vital place within a booming regional economy. The broad appeal of this origin myth, celebrating black political autonomy as a solution to \"The Great Race Problem,\" is based on the mistaken belief that blacks in Central Florida -- like other regions of the South -- were routinely excluded from participation in local politics and civic affairs. In fact, African American voters played a crucial role in the incorporation of Maitland and Winter Park, historically \"white\" towns that border Eatonville. Two African Americans sat on the Winter Park Town Council, and an African American edited the Winter Park newspaper. Freedom Built These Towns as well, yet no signs or monuments commemorate this brief but successful era of biracial governance and civic engagement at the dawn of Jim Crow Era. This paper will propose a new interpretive strategy that better accounts for the formal establishment of black towns and settlements throughout the region, and better integrates Eatonville into that broader regional narrative.

The young, single soldiers who comprised the armed forces flocked to see these women and applauded their efforts to bring a bit of home front femininity to the war zone.  But as the volunteer force took shape in the early 1970s, military families became a more integral part of military life and culture.  This shift in demographics produced a new focus on family programming within military welfare and morale organizations.  Although women remain a fixture of popular USO shows on bases in Bagram and Kandahar, wartime entertainers now include characters like Big Bird and Elmo who also do their part to maintain the morale of military families in the United States.  Today’s recreation programs are designed not only for single enlisted servicemen, but also for single mothers, military families, and military children.  As the U.S. military continues to expand the roles of uniformed women (many of whom are mothers) and continues to rely on military families to bear the burdens of service, morale-building entertainment work serves as one important connection between the armed forces and American society.  The juxtaposition of sexualized women and children’s cartoon characters to build morale signals the complex and contradictory ways that military and civilian officials collaborate to provide for the needs of a diverse force of men, women, and children stationed across the United States and the world.

She also served as full professor at a major university; the first female president of the National Education Association, the nation’s then-preeminent organization of educators at all levels; and the person who most significantly influenced John Dewey to consider the necessary interconnections between education and democracy. Young, a notoriously private person, however, is relatively unknown among historians and other scholars of education today. This paper explores how the author, currently completing a biography of Young, has developed two connected projects: 1) a short video about Young’s life and work, which is the primary focus of this paper, and 2) a companion website. The website contains a complete collection of Young’s published work, gathered in one place for the first time, a project that Young’s surviving companion and John Dewey worked together to accomplish, ultimately unsuccessfully.

The next day he went to the polls to vote. He was turned away. Historians have noted Wisconsinites’ defiance of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law and highlighted the Republican Party’s commitment to black suffrage. Wisconsin Republicans were among the most progressive in the country. Yet, the efforts of antislavery and abolitionist Wisconsinites failed to alter the political marginality that black Wisconsinites faced in the founding decades of the state. Gillespie filed suit against election officials claiming black suffrage had been approved in 1849. The election officials claimed that their actions were lawful because blacks did not have the right of suffrage. In 1849, 5,265 white voters said yes to black suffrage, while 4,075 white voters voted no. However, 31,759 votes had been casted in the general election; so, 22,419 voters chose not to vote on black suffrage at all. The State Board of Canvassers concluded that because a majority of voters did not support the referendum black men could not vote in state of Wisconsin. In 1866, Gillespie appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court and won. A wrongly interpreted technicality kept black men in Wisconsin from the ballot box for seventeen years. Moreover, racism and prejudice among the early settlers of Wisconsin had pushed black people to the political margins. ","Black Suffrage And Settlement In Wisconsin"

As Bryant pushed her way onto the Los Angeles jazz scene in the 1940s and 50s she had to prove herself to those who claimed that a trumpet is a man’s instrument.  After years of documenting the musician's life, Davis faced important questions about the form this biography would take. How would she, as a filmmaker, address the complexities and nuances of Clora Bryant’s life? How did Bryant’s version of her life story differ from the version Davis would tell? Rather than do a biography on Sojourner Truth, Davis decided to take a different approach and examine a few key moments in her life.  Most people think that Truth said the words, Aren’t I a woman? In recent years, however, historians have documented that Truth did not say those words, but Truth took the advantage and allowed others to think that she did. Why did she do this? Since Truth is not around to be interviewed, as a filmmaker I have to take a different approach to exploring this question.    Where do you draw the line between myth and truth?  What strategies were used by Bryant and Truth so that they could have some control over their stories and their image? My presentation probes these thorny concerns.

The hardening of the border that followed the U.S. Canada Boundary Commission of the 1870s did not, however, terminate the cross border movement of Blackfoot bands.  Families visited each other across the line, band members registered on rolls in the U.S. and Canada, and Indian agents fulminated against Blackfoot manipulation of fluid, yet contradictory notions of status, blood, and citizenship.  The international and reservation boundaries as stipulated in Treaties with the Blackfeet circumscribed Indigenous lives and narrowed their options, but Blackfoot bands maintained a surprising degree of movement throughout their homelands.  Following the Blackfoot encapsulates themes associated with the intersections of Indigenous histories and histories of nation-states, particularly their competing notions of law and (il)legality.  The collision of Blackfoot sovereignty and the formation of borders created fluid conceptualizations of citizenship and highly complicated—if not contradictory—discourse over race and racial boundaries.  The projection of nation-state, reservation, and reserve boundaries failed to extinguish Indigenous defined territories that transcended international borders and the legal regimes associated with them.  Although the systems of surveillance sought to galvanize the gaze of the state as it colonized Blackfoot bodies and identities, they proved incapable of caging and containing those same subjectivities as they manipulated the shifting spaces of status, citizenship, blood quantum, and tribal/band identity.","Bloodlines And Boundary Lines: Blackfoot Bands And Families Along The U.s.-Canada Border, 1870-1915"

Jack Dougherty and contributors are creating On The Line: How Schooling, Housing, and Civil Rights Shaped Hartford and its Suburbs (http://OnTheLine.trincoll.edu), a publicly accessible book-in-progress under contract with Amherst College Press.On The Line tells the story of schooling and housing boundaries that shaped American metropolitan life over the past century, and also the civil rights struggles of families and activists to cross over, redraw, or erase these powerful lines. Set in the city of Hartford, Connecticut, and its emerging suburbs, the book explains how this metropolitan area became one of the most racially and economically polarized regions in the northeastern United States. The story highlights how government, business, and white middle-class families drew lines to distance themselves from others, and the evolving coalitions that have sought to reform the relationship between private housing and public education. This digital-first book was designed for the open web. The narrative is wrapped around digital evidence—including interactive maps, videos, and documents—to make hidden boundaries more visible, and to amplify the voices of people who challenged these lines. Also, in an open-access book, history becomes more widely available to the public, without barriers of price or permissions. As educators, we believe that knowledge becomes more valuable when it is easily discoverable and accessible, not hidden behind password-protected paywalls. Moreover, the liberating power of history—and civil rights history in particular—should be freely available, especially for the communities of people who lived these stories. On The Line seeks to blend the best aspects of conventional publishing and web innovation. The main narrative still looks and feels like a scholarly book, divided into chapters and backed up by endnotes. But the web platform allows us to embed digital evidence on the page, and to link directly to external resources located elsewhere. As a result, this book delivers a more comprehensive, coherent, and connected work of scholarship than what was previously possible in print-only publications, or scattered online journal articles and blog posts, at no cost to the reader.For historians considering their own digital book projects, this paper will raise issues and offer resources on the following questions:What different types of narratives about race and education can be told in digital books?How does web publishing change our thinking about access, authorship, and preservation of the past?What possibilities for publication exist today in the spectrum from traditional print-only to digital formats, and hybrid models in between?","Building On The Line: An Open-Access Book On Housing And Schooling In Metropolitan Hartford, Connecticut"

In the same way that spaces between notes are essential for sound to organize itself into rhythm and melody, silences allow us to make sense of any given historical narrative or moment.  This essay thinks through the particular silences engendered by post World War II urban restructuring in the form of federal urban renewal, private urban development and gentrification of working class neighborhoods, all of which result in the mass displacement of vulnerable populations.  Geographic stability is a constitutive element within a community’s ability to form itself into something that could have a voice; that could speak back to political power or that could collect enough personal materials to form an archive.  This essay takes my research into the displacement of black queer population in during periods of intense land investment in postwar Washington, D.C. as a starting point for thinking through those communities’ disinterest in political organizing, archiving or storytelling.  As my work indicates, without access to housing stability or any real control over geographic space, historical actors—even those living in the very recent past—have little relation to historicist projects that presume historical narratives must be collected and stored in one static location.

By 1962 the Golden State was the largest in the Union. With this dynamic increase in population came a similar surge in the Roman Catholic population of California. Today, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles counts nearly 4 million Catholics within its boundaries. The Diocese of Orange alone, consisting of a single county, has over 1 million  Catholics.In 1945 there were 5 Roman Catholic dioceses in the state. Today there are 12. Catholics are over 30 percent of California's population. The Church represents the diversity of California's population served by ethnic parishes and institutions. It also has a present in the equally diverse geographical regions of the state. Catholic hospitals, schools, and agencies of social provision continue to play an enormous role in the state. This paper focuses on post-war growth--from 1945 to 1962--a period of time that dovetails with California's own rise to prominence. This brief consideration of the expansion of the Roman Catholic presence in post-war California offers a case study of similar Roman Catholic growth in the American West.","Catholics In The Golden State: Raising A Catholic Infrastructure In Post-War California, 1945-1962"

Or, it was portrayed as a harsh regime forced on spiritually weak and vulnerable women, their souls and bodies held captive. Celibacy was the waste of a human life—the grave of the heart, as one 1846 anti-Shaker pamphleteer put it. Such popular portrayals ran contrary to the lived experiences of Shakers and Catholic women religious in the antebellum era. Shaker spiritual autobiographies, manuscript records from Catholic orders, and songs and psalms show that the sexual and spiritual choices of these women were the product of deliberate intention, rather than coercion or accident. Celibacy and chastity, sexual identities based on abstinence, were identities to the Shakers and Catholics who embraced these ideals. Individuals practicing sexual abstinence or limitation saw themselves as distinctly different from those who did not.  Yet unlike modern-day sexual identities which are often justified by a born-this-way biological imperative, celibate individuals prided themselves on the unnaturalness of their restraint.  In this sense, the subjects of this study understood desire to be what we would consider to be socially constructed.The divide between a Protestant middle-class print culture and private community records points to antebellum Americans’ narrow conceptions of young women’s spirituality and agency, as well as the threat celibacy posed to white middle-class understandings of womanhood and sexual virtue.

Native peoples, moreover, were no more immunologically unprepared for the disease than peoples of European or African descent.   Cholera afflicted a broad range of Americans in the 1830s, but Indigenous Peoples were made particularly vulnerable to infection and mortality due to the enactment of the U.S. government’s policy of Indian Removal.  An untold number of Natives died from this terrible disease on their forced removals west.  This paper investigates this tragedy through the lens of Indigenous medicine.  It argues that Native peoples experience with cholera would have been much less severe had they been allowed to stay in their homelands and attend to public health on their own terms, but U.S. officials—including President Andrew Jackson—knowingly subjected thousands of Natives to the health hazards of removal and thus allowed an American medical tragedy to happen.","Cholera And The Trail Of Tears: An American Medical Tragedy, 1831-1834"

Yet surviving accounts of African American religious life in the early years of Reconstruction were written almost exclusively by white observers, whether northern missionary teachers or white southerners still hostile to emancipation. These two groups of white Christians, one believing the Bible had supported slavery and the other long committed to antislavery, remained vehemently opposed one another, but they shared certain assumptions that they alone could steer free people toward the proper religious beliefs and practice. Both justified their actions through biblical stories and theological ideas, and to different degrees, both ignored black Christians desire for independence and self-determination.This paper explores the methodological challenges of telling the story of the creation of independent black churches in the post-emancipation South from an archive full of white voices. It demonstrates strategies for reading against the intention of white writers to learn about freed people’s religious lives and work, their collective goals, and their organizing activities. Disputes over biblical interpretation, worship forms, and political alliances illumine the strategies that African American Christians employed to define their religious and political independence. Among these competing communities, Christian identity became a synecdoche for those who belonged and deserved civil and political rights in the post-emancipation United States. As groups across lines of race and politics articulated what good Christian behavior entailed, they drew lines of inclusion and exclusion around American identity during Reconstruction.

Evidence exists that local planning commissions understood that racial zoning maps were unconstitutional but wished to build city plans around them nonetheless, including the location of segregated schools.  They encouraged school boards to place new schools in either racially restricted white suburbs or in increasingly isolated black ghettos while neglecting mixed-race areas.  Thus, school building programs during the 1920s substantially increased the distance between black and white schools, and as a consequence, between black and white homes.  It was not until the end of the decade that city planners recognized that school sites were one of the most powerful tools at their disposal, which at least partially explains why schools, despite their importance, have often been missing from the narrative of residential segregation.  Since school site selection rarely presented a significant challenge to city planners, they never felt the need to advocate for it as strongly or as overtly as more controversial tactics such as zoning.  School boards seldom resisted the recommendations of planning commissions and never to the extent that city councils opposed strict zoning laws.  Moreover, battles over school sites rarely landed in the courtroom, unlike the endless challenges to zoning restrictions.  As a result, planners acquired significant control over school construction before fully recognizing that they had already found a quick, legal, and effective strategy to enforce unofficial racial zoning maps.","City Planners And The Use Of School Sites To Impose Racial Zoning On Southern Cities Before 1930"

Twenty-five weeks into her pregnancy, her cancer returned and metastasized.  Her prognosis was terminal and her condition dire. When George Washington University Hospital administrators learned that Carder was days from death and without a plan to save her fetus, they went to court to determine their responsibility to her pregnancy.  Against the wishes of her family, the court ordered the baby delivered immediately via cesarean section.  Born at twenty-six and a half weeks, the baby lived just two hours. Carder died two days later.  Carder’s case was one of about three dozen cases in the 1980s in which hospitals and doctors went to court to force pregnant women to undergo cesarean sections in order to preserve the life and/or health of their fetuses. Using archival records, legal decisions, medical and popular literature, this paper argues that claims of fetal personhood existed outside of the realm of abortion politics in the 1980s, even as both sides drew up on Roe v. Wade to argue their positions.  It tracks the rationales employed by lawyers, policymakers, and pregnant women both to claim and refute fetal personhood and links them to contemporary medical advances and cultural norms.  It also outlines the ways in which court ordered cesareans reshaped the doctor-patient relationship and contributed to public debates about the legal status of the fetus and of women’s rights in pregnancy.","Claiming And Refuting Fetal Personhood In American Maternity Care, 1979-1990"

Little Liberia was originally established by elite members of the Los Angeles Black community, but later involved Blacks from across the United States and Canada.  The colony’s original goal was to become an agricultural source for California.  By economically influencing the United States from outside its boundaries and prejudiced social systems, Little Liberia's leaders intended to alter White American's perceptions of African Americans and therefore enact social change.  These African Americans proposed to transcend existing cultural and political barriers in the United States and Mexico through cooperation between different races and across borders.  Little Liberia would use the United States-Mexico border as a buffer for United States racial animosity, but also allow economic and social ties to flow across that same border.  Little Liberia’s founders strove to provide a place where both Blacks and Mexicans could come together to enact cross-border change white simultaneously keeping ties across the border back to Los Angeles.  The colonists constantly crossed the border to visit Los Angeles in order to keep community ties.  The unique racial landscape of Los Angeles and the American West played a pivotal role in establishing this relationship.    However, international politics occasionally barred them from crossing back into Baja California, and eventually played a role in the colony’s end ten years later.  Little Liberia's colonists strove to simultaneously create a thriving community that was integrated into the Baja California landscape and use the colony's proximity to the border to enact social change.  The colony, however, eventually succumbed to pressures from international politics, economic struggles, and mismanagement which led its eventual close. This paper will not only discuss the history of Little Liberia, a relatively unknown community, but will also tie together African American and Borderlands histories by looking at the overlapping role both of these topics played in the colony’s aspirations and activities.  To do this, this paper brings in foundational elements of Black Studies and Border histories, including the importance of imaginaries and story-telling.  Rather than reading a paper, this presentation will be presented as a story with analysis woven into the narrative in order to engage the listener while simultaneously modeling the importance of the community’s story in its history.  Advertisements, editorial letters, and stories from community members appeared in Black newspapers in Los Angeles and later in Black newspapers and magazines throughout the country.  These pieces are pivotal for understanding the dreams and aspirations of this community, as well as the larger African American community at this time.  This paper’s presentation will fit on a traditional panel, but can also function in non-traditional spaces.","Co-Opting The Border: African Americans Fighting American Racial Injustice From Baja California"

The story of Indian removal and the subsequent incursion of non-Indians into Indian Territory has long been told and appropriately characterized as a story of colonialism.  This essay expands upon that story by considering how law, lawyers, and the legal system in this uniquely designated place aided and facilitated non-Indians in taking possession of natural resources and how, in response, native people used the law to empower themselves and retain coal resources.  The Choctaws provide a case study of Native Americans who both suffered from the introduction of an alien legal regime and wielded significant influence by adapting to the law and hiring lawyers who sometimes exploited them and at other times effectively fought for and protected their interests.  Law and capitalism worked together in a borderlands region and empowered settlers to exploit indigenous people and their resources.  Conversely, law and capitalism presented a new forum that some indigenous people learned and embraced in order to reap new economic opportunities and empower themselves.

It created global circuits of people, skills and products which brought economic, social, and demographic transformations to coffee-producing colonies. By focusing on Hawai‘i and Taiwan, this paper explores how coffee production became part of the imperial projects before WWII. Although Hawai‘i and Taiwan were under the control of different empires—Hawai‘i under the US empire and Taiwan under the Japanese empire—Japanese migrants constituted a predominant population on both islands. More significantly, some of those who were involved in the production and business of coffee in Hawai‘i contributed to Taiwan’s coffee production before WWII. This Hawai‘i-Taiwan connection established and activated by Japanese diasporas, and through which people, coffee plants and production skills were transplanted, cannot be overlooked for two reasons: First, it highlights the significance of the Asia-Pacific region in the history of coffee production. Since coffee history has been examined predominantly from a Euro-centered perspective, the incorporation of the Asia-Pacific region into its examination allows us to delineate the influences of coffee as an imperial commodity in a larger context. Second, this connection shows the importance of Japanese migrants as agents of the transportation of coffee plants and production skills from a colony of one empire to a colony of the other. This diasporic connection indicates the complexity of networks that crisscrossed the Pacific.

In Phoenix, a quintessential Sunbelt city, elected officials expanded municipal boundaries to increase the potential pool of taxpayers. But before this could occur, civic elites embarked upon a campaign to improve the image of the city to discourage surrounding communities from seeking independent incorporation. Their discursive justifications, along with the municipal pattern of annexation, ensured that Anglo elites would retain political sovereignty over public funds despite the annexation of unincorporated communities of color. The actions of civic elites and city officials were sufficient to entice white residents to choose annexation into multi-racial Phoenix, along with its lower tax rates, in contrast with independent incorporation on the metropolitan fringe.

The rise of a parallel set of nonprofit organizations, known as intermediaries, directly facilitated this maturation through the packaging and leveraging of private investment for low-income neighborhoods. Sometimes chartered by state legislatures or neighborhood residents, other times initiated by corporate leaders or philanthropists, and always structured as nonprofit organizations, these intermediaries sought to yoke neighborhood improvement to capital markets through strategies of asset acquisition, debt financing, and tax syndication. This paper explores the history of community development in Boston during the 1970s and 1980s to argue that the rise of financial language and tools in the social sector emerged as much from grassroots activists needing access to capital as it did from elites looking for new ways to deploy their wealth for charitable purposes. By claiming to have proved that low-income housing could produce both a financial profit for investors and a neighborhood benefit, Boston intermediaries helped accelerate the larger embrace of market-oriented funding strategies in the philanthropic and nonprofit sectors. That these new funding mechanisms continued to include the state as a financial partner and source of legitimacy also reveals how the financialization of social welfare developed not as a rejection of the state’s role, but a redefinition of it.

Recently, a hormonal birth control shot developed for men received a lot of media attention because studies conducted in 2011 and 2012 showed that it was (perhaps) associated with an increase in depression and sterility in some men. The serious side effects of hormonal birth control for women include stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolisms, an increased risk of developing certain cancers, and depression. By comparison, hormonal birth control seems much safer for men than for women. It is important to alert everyone to the possible health risks associated with hormonal birth control, but the amount of media coverage the comparatively mild side-effects pose to men is not proportionate to actual risk, which is small. The inverse is true for women. Women who take hormonal birth control (potentially) risk their lives, but the Pill is often portrayed as a safe method for preventing pregnancy (and early warnings by activists like Barbara Seaman who published, The Doctor’s Case Against the Pill (1969) did not receive enough attention).   This paper explores these asymmetric standards by analyzing the social environment in which hormonal birth control for women was developed and approved for use (1940-1960s), particularly the tensions that emerged between feminist groups who supported the Pill because it gave women greater control over sexual freedom and family planning and the researchers who warned of the deleterious side-effects of hormonal birth control. Focusing on these tensions will uncover some of the reasons why taking hormonal birth control despite the risk became a sign of freedom for women. Iconic feminist activists like Margaret Sanger and Mary Ware Dennett campaigned for hormonal birth control, and Katharine McCormick funded much of the Pill’s research and development. The Pill not only represented a form of birth control, but also an important moment for feminists: the ability to prevent pregnancy could free women to enjoy sex without worrying about unplanned pregnancy, to pursue careers, and to have more control over the size and timing of their families.          I argue that while the social benefits of the pill tremendously benefited women, they eclipsed the health risks associated with the pill. Even today, critics of the pill’s health risks often face hostility from feminists who associate criticism of the pill with criticism of social progress. Separating the social and the medical aspects of the Pill allows us to rethink hormonal birth control without inadvertently attacking feminism and positive social change for women. This approach invites more fruitful discussion of viable alternative methods of birth control for both men and women. Making birth control a human issue rather than a feminist issue might also finally end the disparity in perceived costs and benefits of taking hormonal birth control, making its use safe and more widespread in both women and men.

Staffed by a small but dedicated group of volunteer doctors, lawyers, hippies, and housewives, the LAFC was originally viewed as a problematic addition to the Fairfax neighborhood in Los Angeles, and was perceived as a place for drug addicts, transients, and promiscuous teenagers to gather. Others expressed concern that staff, including doctors, were handing out LSD and marijuana to patients. By the early 1970s, however, the LAFC found itself a welcome and legitimized part of the Los Angeles County health care system, working closely with the LA County health department, an organization that had tried to shut down the clinic just a few years earlier, and lauded by local media and city government.  This paper argues that this shift in perception occurred in part due to alliances made between the staff of the LAFC and local government officials who gradually began to give support to the fledgling, and sometimes floundering, organization. These alliances allowed for the open exchange of ideas, as both sides worked toward a similar goal: to provide aid to the city’s disadvantaged. The creation of these alliances allowed the LAFC to flourish and grow, and brought a sense of legitimacy and respectability to this anti-Establishment health care center.  Likewise, the local health department began implementing ideas from the LAFC in their creation of new county health clinics, creating a seemingly mutually beneficial period of cooperation between Counterculture and Establishment.","Counterculture Versus Establishment: Health Care And Cooperation In 1970S Los Angeles"

Best known as a homesteader who influenced 1960s back-to-the-landers and environmentalists, Nearing grew up looking for unifying truths across religions within a Theosophical system that equally valued natural science. She wed her belief in the universal brotherhood of humanity to the socialist economic theories and pacifism that had gotten her partner arrested and blackballed from academia by 1919. While often hidden behind her husband’s public persona, her publishing from 1950 through 1995 and public talks skillfully translated dense radical theory and spiritual philosophy to advance respect for all life. Helen Nearing’s thought developed from presenting plants and rocks as natural resources for human consumption to a larger focus on the personhood of all living beings and subjecthood of seemingly insentient natural phenomena—a conceptual shift with serious implications for human interactions with the rest of the world. She represents a longer history of American religious and anti-capitalist dissidence that has valued equality, liberty, freedom from want, and personal growth despite roots in imperialist capitalist colonization.","Cultivating Humaneness By Grafting Together Natural Science And Spirituality"

Stories about Mink’s political achievements as well as her exotic status as an Asian woman from the Pacific Islands circulated both nationally and internationally as part of U.S. Cold War cultural diplomacy.  This presentation analyzes how these depictions of Mink interpreted her historic political achievement through normative discourses.  I also examine how Mink navigated these expectations as she lobbied for progressive agendas that challenged U.S. Cold War militarism. Asian American history during the Cold War has received more attention in recent years.  The scholarship of Cindy I-Fen Cheng, Ellen Wu, and Madeline Hsu reveal how the racialization of Asian Americans was shaped by U.S. international and domestic agendas concerning decolonization and civil rights.  Gender was central to this changing racialization of Asian Americans.  The efforts by Asian Americans to integrate into white suburbs and the emergence of the model minority discourse, which represents Asian Americans as having strong nuclear families, illustrate how gender normativity has buttressed claims for racial inclusion.  My proposed presentation will utilize intersectional approaches to analyze the political career of Patsy Mink. She challenged racial, gender, and regional barriers to become a U.S. Congresswoman, but her achievements were contained within Cold War normative discourses.  ","Dancing Hula In Congress: Patsy T.

Yet Hearst reached a far larger audience in the following decades, as he built up a chain of over twenty papers, mostly based in smaller cities such as Syracuse, Oakland, and San Antonio.  Through the 1910s and 1920s, Hearst papers were rarely an immediate success.  In fact, each time the chain took over a local newspaper, stuffing it full of bland editorials, mass-produced features, and news by wire, that paper lost thousands of readers.  Yet Hearst found that by adding very limited local news and features, often fitted into a template shared by all of his papers, he could satisfy his readers’ desire for local information and make his newspapers a viable, profitable enterprise.  Hearst’s early sensational news tactics and his attempted political career have received more attention than the everyday workings of his newspaper chain.  This paper argues, however, that the business model of the Hearst chain is perhaps Hearst’s most lasting news legacy.  Historians have sometimes described the coming of mass market capitalism as the local losing out to the national: the corner store succumbing to the Sears catalog, the local weekly ceding to the Saturday Evening Post.  Hearst’s newspapers, though, straddled the local and the national.  This tactic created mass media that could thrive in a local context.","Delivering Local News Via Mass Media: The Hearst Newspaper Chain, 1910-1930"

Whereas elite British Indians had once pursued higher education mostly in the colonial metropole, England, by the end of the century, middle- and upper-class Indians and Pakistanis opted for the universities in the United States. This transformation was, most obviously the result of new legislation, namely the Immigration and Nationality Act (1965). This paper demonstrates, however, that it was through careful planning and concerted effort, that the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Information Agency put American higher education on the radar of South Asian students well before passage of the 1965 act. The Cold War-era programs of the American state drew the United States sharply into the consciousness of tens of thousands of Indians and Pakistanis. In addition to sending South Asians to the United States through passage of the Fulbright Act (1946) and Smith-Mundt Act (1948), the State Department and USIS exhausted every opportunity to send American lecturers, exchange professors, performers, and athletes to hundreds of schools, colleges and universities throughout India and Pakistan. They held education workshops, arranged for consultations with American educators, hosted lectures on the merits of American education, and even facilitated the college application process. As a result, the United States emerged as the prime destination for higher education. While some experienced the United States personally, others learned about American education secondhand, but both groups spread word in their own family and social circles.

By 1971, the ROC had expanded these missions to over two dozen countries across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.This paper will discuss the emergence of development as a space for public diplomacy during the Cold War.  Specifically, it examines how development became an ideological battleground for the hearts and minds of the Global South.  United States planners believed that Taiwanese missions to the Global South would bolster its own development credentials since it touted Taiwan as a graduate of two decades of US development aid.  Taiwanese diplomats traded technical expertise and development projects in exchange for votes in the UN, but simultaneously utilized the rhetoric of technical aid as international and domestic propaganda.  Demonstrations of Taiwanese expertise abroad, showcasing the superiority of Taiwanese techniques, generated nationalistic sentiments at home that helped legitimize the regime.","Development Diplomacy In The Cold War: Taiwan And Us Development Missions To Vietnam And Africa, 1959-1971"

The tour marked the culmination of an effort that spanned Clinton’s presidency to promote private sector investment and access to loans and capital as the main route to addressing poverty and inequality in distressed communities. This tour provides a point of departure for exploring the ethos of doing well by doing good and Clinton and the New Democrats vision of public-private partnership. This paper will highlight the particular role of third sector institutions and foundations in that equation that ultimately gave rise to the objectives of Clinton’s own post-presidency foundation. Examining these policies in closer detail also provide a means to interrogate the complexity and spectrum of ideas about government, the market and private sector since the 1970s. It also provides a means to probe the development of a Democratic and liberal version of neoliberalism, and the role of foundations in fostering it, which has come to shape many of the prevailing ideas about markets and private investment as a tool to address to poverty and social inequality.

Mexico’s North (exemplified in this paper by Coahuila) was a particularly besieged territory, and one that Mexicans desperately hoped to hold. In an effort to settle this area with loyal citizens, a number of interesting projects arose to bring Coahuila, a key Northern Mexican state, under Mexico’s control in the 1850s. Military colonies were one option tested out by the Mexican government. So too was the project of the so-called Immigrant Tribes (Tribus Emigradas). The immigrant tribes were invited to Mexico and consisted of Black Creeks, Seminoles, and Kickapoos. Mexican officers in the North imagined these newcomers would take up arms in defense of their adopted patria. But what looked like a convergence of interests to Mexican officials represented something quite different to the Indians invited to settle Mexico. The Immigrant Tribes imagined their settlement on the Southwest border as a sort of independent pan-Indian colony outside of the purview of both Mexico and the United States. This imagined quasi-autonomous Native territorial entity ultimately floundered by the early 1860s. The reasons for this were various, but most importantly independent Indians and Mexicans found that they had very different visions for the area’s future. Mexican vecinos and officials alike realized that the Indians had no intention of assimilating. Instead, they hoped to carve out their own territory in northern Coahuila.","Dueling Futurities: Independent Indians And Mexicans In Coahuila, 1848-1861 "

In their initial meeting, the women focused their attention on Wisconsin Senator Robert LaFollette Jr, deluging him with letters demanding that he bring the issue of demobilization to the Senate floor.  A number of women told their senator about their problems with household matters.  Mrs. Hazel Corso, for example, included an itemized list of household expenses, showing that the $100 allotment she received from the Army would not begin to cover the over $120 of regular expenses.  Mrs. Helen Sprigs explained that she could not afford orange juice, even though it was good for her children.  Mrs. Harrison Duffy complained that her children were going without cod liver oil (presumably the children were not overly upset by this). These letters reveal an economic and moral anxiety caused by the war.  The letters also reveal a complex interrelation between families, society, and the U.S. military at the end of World War Two.  These women felt that their status as mothers required them to defend their families, and that this need to defend gave them a right and a duty to dictate military policy.  Michael Timonin’s research in Duffy’s Cod Liver Oil: Domestic Economy and the Demobilization of World War Two will explore these complicated interactions and the long lasting ramifications of the women’s intervention into American foreign policy.","Duffy’s Cod Liver Oil: Domestic Economy And The Demobilization Of World War Two "

Placing the device on a desk, Edison turned a crank on its side and the machine inquired as to our health, asked how we liked the phonograph, informed us that it was very well, and bid us a cordial good night.  The words chosen to describe this, the first record-listening party, are evocative. The machine speaks. It asks after its interlocutors’ health (affirming its own,) sounds their opinions and issues a valediction on its own behalf.  Three decades later a widely-circulated advertisement for the Victor Phonograph Company  juxtaposed a depiction of famed tenor Enrico Caruso and a record of his performance of Celeste Aida. Both are Caruso, it declared. The Victor Record of Caruso’s voice is just as truly Caruso as Caruso himself.  It actually is Caruso… The phonograph is no longer a talking machine but has become a conduit for sounds, events, persons and personalities elsewhere. This paper focuses on changes in American perceptions of sonic phenomena in the years after the invention of the phonograph in 1877. It argues that the talking machine and the talking machine industry populated the world with mass-produced sonic persons, socializing Americans to the subjective slipperiness of commodity capitalism.  Finally, it argues that— while sound recording technology represented a nineteenth century innovation— the enchantment it brought about drew on and made visible much older strains of enchantment in modern thought and practice.","Early Sound Recording And The Enchantment Of Modernity"

This paper explores the relationship between oral history and performance in research on racialized women who traveled on nightclub circuits during the Cold War. Scholars have explored how the U.S. used official cultural diplomacy to craft an image as a benevolent racial democracy. Less explored, however, is how performers also traveled on nightclub circuits fulfilling a commercial demand for a desirable racial other. To access the stage, performers had to be legible within racialized and sexualized tropes such as the geisha and the dancing Latina. Yet in oral histories with these performers there has been a noticeable silence about race – at least in words.Analyzing oral histories with dancers Dorothy Toy and Teresa Champion, this paper argues that both women used the live body to critique and reimagine the American mythology of racial democracy. Oral history consists of narration and performance. As Toy and Champion narrated their careers, they made use of gesture, an impromptu step, or the humming of a tune to bring past performances to life. They described, but also embodied how they had used dance to engage critically with the past during the Cold War. Through choreography, costume, and genre they reworked the racial tropes into which their audiences placed them.  Toy and Champion should be regarded as skillful storytellers using dance to engage with the past. Centering embodiment brings out new critical perspectives on American history.","Embodying The Past: Oral Histories With Nightclub Performers From The Cold War Era"

This paper would like to examine how left-wing Jewish writers of the \"Popular Front period\" articulated their critiques of Zionism  as part of a larger global proletarian literary movement.  Gold and other proletarian U.S. writers articulated a class-based Jewish identity through a rejection of whiteness.   As the debate around Zionism exploded after World War II, other left-wing Jewish writers such as Abe Polonsky, John Sanford, and Howard Fast, continued their opposition to Zionism.  While the debate was in part over imperialism and geopolitics, it was also a debate about how to understand and formulate the racial subjectivity of Jewishness.  This paper thus hopes to recover an important legacy of Jewish, proletarian, anti-imperialist writing, as well as the theoretical implications of racial subjectivity and self-making in the political alignment of Jewish racial formation in the mid-twentieth century.

Launching from R. A. Lawson’s recent conceptualization of blues music as Jim Crow's counterculture and building on the rich foundation laid by Angela Davis in Blues Legacies and Black Feminism, this presentation highlights an expanded notion of African American blues music as an alternative form of resistance and historical repository – one that is not male-dominant, masculinist, or even necessarily militant in conventional socio-political terms. Like African American working-class women generally under Jim Crow, African American blueswomen in the era of the blues recording boom of the 1920s struggled under race, class, and gender oppression, both within the public and private spheres of everyday life. Gertrude Ma Rainey, who fronted The Assassinators of the Blues, and Bessie Smith, The Empress of the Blues, among others, expressed a defiant alternative consciousness in the emergent radical form The Blues, and flaunted a defiant alternative lifestyle in their commercial personae and activities. Blueswomen challenged dominant cultural norms of femininity, patriarchy, domesticity, heterosexuality, and the modern capitalist work ethic. Denied formal channels of political resistance, they were resistors in an image of their own making. Before the organized movement resistance of the Old and New Left, African American blueswomen set a mold of modern rebellion in the early twentieth century that would only be emulated later in the mainstream of U.S. alienation.[Audio equipment request]","Empresses And Assassinators: Blueswomen And Alternative Forms Of Resistance"

Centred on the Nile Valley, this paper argues that the American engineering diaspora was the key protagonist connecting the United States to empires across the world at the turn of the twentieth century. Using British colonial and American business archives, this paper explores collaborative Anglo-American engineering projects in Uganda and the Sudan as a specific form of inter-imperial connectivity and examines how historical actors themselves imagined and managed patterns of long-distance connection. To do so, it focusses on bridge-building projects in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and in the British East Africa Protectorate undertaken by American firms.The paper proposes a framework of global connectivity defined by inter-imperial interaction as one solution to navigating the tensions between imperial and global history. Inter-imperial projects often took the form of industrial sub-contracting, were collaborative in nature, and were organized by non-state actors and institutions. Central to the management of these inter-imperial relationships were networks of American engineers and experts who mediated the transfer of ideas, expertise, and technology across and between empires. At once both collaborative and competitive, the framework of inter-imperialism recaptures the mutual influences that shaped Empires and opens up the analytical ground for historians of the United States in the world to think across national, regional, imperial, and global scales of space.","Engineering The Scramble For Africa: American Engineers And Histories Of The United States In The World"

Directed especially at ethnic Mexican and subsequently also Filipino populations, the repatriation drives of the 1930s reflected the extent to which the contemporary crisis of capitalism was also a crisis for prevailing terms of social order, citizenship, and belonging.  My paper explores grassroots responses to repatriation in the context of 1930s California in order to illuminate how those targeted by repatriation constructed notions of identity and belonging for themselves, against those that dominated national discourses of citizenship.  Drawing on sources that include archival records, newspapers, corridos and other forms of cultural production, I shed light on the daily struggles, decision-making practices, modes of cultural production and political organizing engaged by targeted populations in their efforts to navigate the world around them in the age of repatriation. I call attention to currents of transnational belonging that crystallized at the grassroots and consider how those currents combined imperatives for civil rights with transnational and global visions of social justice.  Moreover, I reflect on their implications for broader understandings of working-class politics in the age of the Depression and New Deal.","Envisioning Belonging In The Age Of Expulsion: Grassroots Responses To Repatriation In 1930S California"

As you might imagine, Richmond found his petition to himself to be quite persuasive.  It was framed in the language of the poor law, making a case that the Providence overseers of the poor start warning out people who failed the town’s tests of moral character and ability to support themselves.  The petition used the language of the poor law so fluently that it could only have been written by an overseer of the poor.  But the petition went beyond previous recommendations to the overseers of the poor by arguing that vagabond blacks should be the chief object of the overseers’ warnings out.  The petition asked that the overseers use what had been a color-blind law in ways that were anything but colorblind.  The overseers happily complied, beginning periodic roundups of the black community that lasted more than two decades in Providence.  Richmond’s 1806 petition to himself was perhaps the most explicit use of the poor laws to justify ethnic cleansing in early republican Providence.  In practice, though, overseers around the North used colorblind poor laws as tools of ethnic cleansing repeatedly.  This paper will highlight a handful of the most provocative primary sources connecting the poor laws to race in Rhode Island.  The author will argue that municipal power was one of the most immediate and overpowering avenues through which people of color encountered white supremacy in the North.

As the Jewish family members and friends scattered to three continents, they sought to remain in contact with those left behind and others who shared a life in exile, particularly the new constellation of family members developing in the United States. Yet the writers’ inability to assist one another led to an extreme degree of self-censorship. Hiding marital abuse, life-threatening illness, and wartime peril meant saving correspondents from worry and despair. Letters to others, diaries, and oral histories make clear the lengths to which these correspondents went in order to spare one another emotional pain. At the same time, expressing love and concern, joy, and satisfied monotony could sustain their ties and make it through censorship as correspondence became more difficult in wartime. People in a variety of relationships—lovers, siblings, parents and children, former roommates and friends—made decisions about which emotions to write. They did this within the emotional landscape of their times and places, but also in the context of wartime disruptions and extensive migrations. By examining this collection in light of which emotional content people expressed, this paper takes up the call by scholars of migration such as Hasia Diner and David Gerber along with scholars of emotion such as Peter Stearns. It builds upon the author’s work on the presence/absence of emotional language in marriage arrangement letters by migrants.","Exiled Emotions: Sharing And Hiding Information In The Letters Of An Austrian Refugee Family"

A few months later at the inaugural meeting of the United Nations, the delegate from India declared that the growing tide of racism spreading throughout America and other parts of the world presented a problem more serious than war between nations. In post-war America, these fears were personified by the actions of Theodore Bilbo who advocated the open use of violence against people of color who attempted to vote in that summer's Democratic primary.This paper builds on the work of Carol Anderson, Penny Von Eschen, Mary Dudziak, and others who have examined America’s political and racial climate in the post-war period on the global stage. It adds to the conversation of these scholars by foregrounding the important role Bilbo’s election played in shaping the ideology of modern conservatism both domestically and abroad after the war and extending the traditional timeline of the rise of conservative politics in America held by scholars such as Elizabeth Fones-Wolf and Joseph Crespino. Perhaps most importantly, Bilbo's Senate campaign illuminates the deep connective tissues that bind race, conservatism, and Cold War geopolitics in the mid-twentieth century. Using Bilbo’s election as a prism through which to view the roots of conservatism allows scholars to more accurately understand the rise of veiled racial rhetoric and how it has come to be a staple of neoliberal political discourse in the present.

Using the Vietnam war as portrayed in the novel The Things They Carried by Tim O’Brien as its starting point, faculty members asked students to examine various accounts of warfare----Hollywood films, comedic skits, television shows, popular music, social media etc.----and juxtapose those fictionalized accounts against the politics of what really happened. To ascertain the truth about warfare, students conducted and examined oral histories with real soldiers who fought in Vietnam and the various present-day Gulf conflicts. Students then examined primary documents---such as soldier’s letters, newspaper accounts, speeches from politicians from the 1960s to present day, and various media outlets---to decipher inconsistencies between the reality and perception of warfare. Lastly, students were asked to discuss the role of fake news and fiction in creating the historical record and the problems this creates for the historian and the public at large.O’Brien, a former journalist turned novelist, was a perfect individual to use as a framework to understand the tenuous connection between politics, entertainment, reality, perception, fact and fiction. This paper includes a description of how the project was structured, details the various types of entertainment students examined, and provides survey results from students regarding the use of fact and fiction to understand warfare. In addition, four students had an extended conversation with the project faculty regarding their experiences with the novel, popular culture, the media, their own experiences as soldiers, and the project itself; their stories are shared in the paper.  Finally, the paper discusses the faculty member’s perceptions of the project’s outcomes, including the use of alternative assessments (non-traditional essay assignments, multi-media presentations, etc.) for students to present and support a thesis regarding the role of entertainment in the historical record.","Fiction V Facts:  Juxtaposing The Media, Hollywood, And Oral Histories To Uncover The Truth Behind Warfare"

Fifty years ago, King’s dream for racial-economic justice, labor rights, and peace came together during his Poor People’s Campaign and the black sanitation workers’ strike in Memphis, Tennessee. On March 18, 1968, King rallied black workers, students, and teachers for a general strike. Had the strike been successful and had King lived, this would have opened up a new labor and civil rights alliance that King called the second phase of the black freedom movement, the struggle for economic equality. Instead, despite the rise of black political power, right-wing Republican legislators overturned majority-black Shelby County minimum wage increases, a unified school taxing district, and union rights. Memphis developed the highest poverty rate of any city of its size. Through oral history, film clips, and music, this presentations asks how should we remember King? Drawing on his film, Love and Solidarity, and his current book project, King’s Unfinished Agenda, Honey links nonviolence history to present-day organizing, civil rights unionism, and immigrant rights, with King’s unfinished agenda for union rights, economic equality, and an end to racism, poverty, and war.

Beginning in 1947, the Philippine-Ryukyus Command (PHILRYCOM), a subordinate command under the authority of the Commander-in-Chief of the Far East (CINCFE), recruited Filipinos for employment in the construction, operation, and maintenance of military installations on Okinawa. In addition to Filipinos, the U.S. military employed Ryukyuan laborers, natives of Okinawa, who had been forced out of agricultural work by the war and occupation—of the nearly 75,000 Okinawans who labored for the US military, 80% had been driven out from the rural communities through land expropriations. Furthering structuring a labor market increasingly defined by U.S. policy, the military and military contractors employed flexible racial categories to determine wages. In practice, this meant that imported labor, largely Filipinos, earned higher wages than their Ryukyuan counterparts. US occupation officials responded to local protests regarding wage inequality by promising to phase out the use of foreign workers. These efforts, however, were not simply responses to Ryukyuan labor protests. Instead, the creation of English language and technical training courses for Ryukyuan laborers and eventually the forcible repatriation of Filipino laborers from Okinawa were part of broader Pacific-wide system. I argue that the circulation of low-wage labor reproduced an imperial system based on deep wage inequalities, revealing how the geographical expansion of U.S. national security and U.S. capital were mutually constituted in the early postwar period.","Filipino Laborers And The U.s.

They focused less upon the present need philanthropic dollars might fulfill and more on the future these resources might endow, through aggregation, investment, and imagined eternal growth. In this way, American Jews contributed crucially to the financialization of American-Jewish philanthropy, of American philanthropy, and of the American public. American Jews worked in concert with multiple groups—from other religious and ethnic collective entities to large nonprofit stakeholders—and responded to economic, political, and cultural forces not of their own making, while, nonetheless, playing a pivotal role the financialization of American philanthropic practice. Their aspirations for modern Jewish life were inseparable from their commitments to American progress through the growth of free markets, decentralized economic opportunities, and pluralistic politics, all managed by a state that nourished non-statist means of power through financial practices. Even as American historians over the last decade have turned their attention to the American state and, especially, its relationship to capitalist expansion, few have given more than a passing nod to philanthropy. Yet massive transformations in philanthropic practice and rhetoric after World War II served as profound pathways for the expansion of market logic into new spheres of American life, including domestic and international policy and intimate matters of identity, spirituality, and community.

This study relies on archival research, oral histories, and legal analysis to understand the five distinctive waves of repatriation and banishment that included voluntary, coerced, and forced removals during the following periods: 1831-1892, 1921-1923, 1929-1933, 1934-1938, and 1939-1944. The numerical records of removals during the Mexican Repatriation drives are staggering, scholars and governmental agencies, however, disagree on an exact number. Estimates usually range from a low 400,000 to a high 2,000,000. There are numerous factors contributing to the different estimates. For instance, some only report the numbers on official federal deportation records; while others call attention to the fact that repatriations were conducted by local agencies and thus left no trace on federal statistical records. Additionally, distinction between forced, voluntary, and coerced departures are not always clear resulting in diverse estimates. Moreover, studies and archival records rarely differentiate between banishment and repatriation as Mexicans were grouped for removal without consideration to their legal status. The different set of years under consideration adds to the disputes because some studies only include the decade of the 1930s, others only the first four years of that decade, but there were different waves of repatriation and banishment ranging from 1831 to 1944. Examining the similarities and differences between each removal wave helps us understand the particular experiences of each cohort and the difference in prolonged consequences across generations.","Five Repatriation & Banishment Waves: Rethinking The Mexican Repatriation Program"

The island group includes the most-populated Chichi Jima and arguably the most famous Iwo Jima, although the latter was excluded from the World Heritage Site since it is a military base.  What makes the Bonins unique, however, is not just their nature but also their unprecedented transnational history.  The Bonin islanders, consisting of variety of race and ethnic groups from all over the world, have been deeply affected by the Pacific War and the Cold War, which divided the peoples.  Moreover, for former Iwo Jima islanders, the Cold War has not ended since they are not yet allowed to return to their home due to the military use of the island.This presentation aims to introduce the history of the Bonin islands and their peoples in the context of U.S.-Japan relations as well as its historiography.  There are two main questions to be answered.  The first is why Bonin Islanders were racially divided and forced to be refugees during the Cold War era.  The second is why former Iwo Jima islanders have not yet been allowed to go back to their home island while other Bonin Islanders were all allowed to live on the islands where they were from.  To explore this matter, U.S.-Japan imbalanced security relations after World War II and U.S. nuclear strategy in the Far East are also discussed.  The presentation is based mainly on diplomatic documents from national archives in both the U.S. and Japan, interview records of the islanders, and Japan’s latest Iwo Jima policy that is studied from the official reports of the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare as well as newly passed law regarding the problem of collection war remains in Iwo Jima.","Forgotten People Of Iwo Jima: A Study On The Post-World War Ii History Of Iwo Jima Islanders In The Context Of The U.s.-Japan Security Relations"

This paper examines the blank forms used to collect this data, exploring the way planners viewed the reproductive attitudes of white women.

It focuses on Frank Rizzo—Philadelphia’s controversial police commissioner-turned mayor—and his white, blue-collar supporters. Rizzo was a quintessential backlash politician. While recent scholarship has overturned the long-dominant backlash narrative that formerly characterized the rise of the modern right, it still dominates treatments of urban and working-class antiliberalism. This paper complicates the story of urban, working-class backlash. It argues that the rise of blue-collar conservatism represented a populist variant of modern American politics that did not immediately abandon welfare liberalism. To the contrary, this paper shows how it derived from the mutually reinforcing promotion of law and order conservatism and the selective rejection of liberalism. Explaining how structural and cultural forces within the city and nation created a powerful sense of blue-collar class privilege, it also illustrates how blue-collar whites used their class identities to obfuscate discourses of racial privilege and challenge urban liberalism. By relocating the narrative in the spatial politics of the urban North, this work challenges studies that view modern conservatism as an exclusive product of suburban communities in the South and West. Northeastern working-class urbanites brought complementary but different motivations to movement conservatism. I argue that the inclusion of blue-collar conservatism in the history of America’s right turn is essential for understanding not only changes in urban working class politics, but also the broader history of modern conservatism.

Iowa was hit hard by the depression—the banking system in the state collapsed, as did farm prices.  Foreclosures and unemployment destroyed lives and bred despair, leading to desperate rural protests.  Iowa led the nation in bank failures from 1921 to 1931, with an average of 87 banks failing each year.  It also had the largest total mortgage debt in the country—more than twice any other state.  Desperate unemployed women in Des Moines turned to prostitution to survive, charging from one to three dollars for sex.  Families burned corn to stay warm over the winter, as they did not have the money for fuel.  A barter economy dominated rural parts of the state, as people exchanged food and clothing to survive.  They shared houses to save expenses and grew potatoes in their backyards. In those last trying months under Hoover, a chaotic situation came frightfully close to anarchy, wrote John M. Wilkinson.

Uniting gay and lesbian, Chicana/o, labor, African American, and feminist organizations, the coalition spearheaded a sustained boycott of Coors beer. Boycotters targeted the Coors Brewing Company and family for anti-unionism, discriminatory employment practices, and conservative politics. Many heralded the boycott as unique, powerful, and political. Ten years later, it was over. The now-nationwide boycott of Coors beer formally came to a close in 1987, after Coors signed agreements with the NAACP, AFL-CIO, and other organizations to that effect. These settlements also reflected the fragmentation of the boycott coalition. So what happened? Histories of cross-racial, inter-organizational alliances in the long civil rights era have been the subject of innovative and ground-breaking scholarly work over the past decade. Much of this literature, however, focuses on the long 1960s. This paper, examining the trajectory of the Coors boycott coalition, will bring this conversation into the 1980s. It argues that Reagan-era economic policies and corporate strategy, rather than internal disagreements, fragmented the coalition. Activists pragmatically, if reluctantly, accepted financial support from Coors in return for a pledge to end their boycott. In conclusion, this paper, by examining the strange career of the boycott coalition, will shed new light on processes of collaboration and disunity, offering the boycott as a cautionary tale for activists and coalitions today.","From Boycott To Buyouts: The Rise And Fall Of The Coors Boycott Coalition In The 1980S"

I investigate the change from within the academy—at the School of Criticism and Theory and by the Theory and History of Literature book series—and from outside the academy—Critical Theory trading cards, witty and playful books like Plato and a Platypus Walk into a Bar…, and various cartoon introductions to French Theory. These diverse enterprises helped to produce consumers of theory and to create the empire of theory in America during the last three decades of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century. By embracing theories that enlarged the scope of critical exercises to a universal practice of thought, these theory enterprises and their consumers advanced the neoliberal mission to foster efficient knowledge transfer. Beyond historicizing this phenomenon, my paper also contemplates reasons why this new mode of theory was so well received. One possible explanation is that, because philosophy as a way of life had been deemphasized in American philosophy departments, literature departments took up the mantel of theory as a way of life. Meanwhile, for the American public, the above enterprises met the demand. Consumers of theory sought philosophical-spiritual self-examination and found it—accessible, affordable, and palatable.

Moral reformers and abolitionists organized these institutions purportedly to rescue poor, enslaved, and immigrant women from sexual trafficking by shuttling them instead to domestic workplaces. But despite framing paid domestic labor as a rescue from prostitution and slavery, the matrons who extracted housework from their inmates engendered similar forms of commodification: public inspection of workers’ bodies, geographic displacement, family separation, and sexual exploitation. Matrons positioned themselves as the rightful proprietors of feminized labor during the very creation of a wage-based labor market by contrasting themselves with the madams of brothels. Workers, including madams, resisted such treatment in various ways but faced unexpected constraints. By the late 1830s, matrons had developed new partnerships with the state through corporate charters and municipal police laws. The consequences of displacing nineteenth-century sex workers—of forcing them to move from brothels to asylums, from bedrooms to kitchens—were manifold. This process of displacement eroded women’s safety within sexual commerce by diminishing toleration of urban brothels. Perhaps its most troubling long-term effect, however, was to authorize the rise of a deeply gendered, racialized, and undervalued market in care work. From Madams to Matrons reveals the early American roots of coerced domestic labor during the period of gradual emancipation in the North. The institutions and discourses formed during this period later shaped the well-documented labor politics of the Reconstruction South and recent care-workers’ movements.","From Madams To Matrons: Sex Work And Domestic Labor In The Northern United States, 1790-1848"

Rather than performing pedagogical or didactic interpretation in the manner of costumed tour guides, living history practitioners were learning agricultural and culinary skills, studying the beliefs and backgrounds of their subjects, and, most importantly, living and interacting with audiences as denizens of the past. By the middle of the decade, more established institutions like the Smithsonian and the National Park Service were experimenting with living history programming, although the practice was met with controversy from other professional corners.What is less studied are the reasons for such a surge, and the individual motivations and assumptions that nascent living history practitioners were bringing to these efforts. My paper will examine these early cohorts of living history practitioners, focusing specifically on the ways in which certain aspects of countercultural practice (commune living, individuated experience, handicraft) informed the ways in which living history practitioners, many who came from academic history backgrounds, were forming this new interpretive field.

Where does this image come from? Is this the image the Marine Corps maintains from within its ranks? This paper argues that the answer to these questions is far more complex than the stereotype might lead one to believe. I examined a sample of issues of the Marine Corps newsletter, Leatherneck, from the 1920s to the 1990s to investigate the presentation of Marine bodies in its pages, noting how the expression of masculinity and femininity on the body changed through time, as well as how it remained stable. I contrast this sample with images of Marines from Time, a mainstream news magazine aimed at a middle-class American audience. This comparison shows change and continuity in the perception of the Marine body and Marine gender through time. Aaron Belkin argues that masculinity and femininity intertwine in military environments, and R.W. Connell’s Masculinities and Judith Halberstam’s Female Masculinity point to the variety of gender expression, supporting my argument in favor of a more fluid definition of military gendering. Challenging the stereotype of the Marine as the epitome of masculinity raises further questions about the equal treatment of male and female Marines into the contemporary era. Understanding the nuances of gender within the Marine Corps will lead to increased equality for all Marines in the future.","Gender Expression And The Body: Images Of Marines From Leatherneck And Time"

In addition to images of the leading players of the period, photographs of relatively unknown burlesque actresses, ballet dancers and other female performers were produced for commercial circulation. Sheet music of sentimental songs suitable for the middle-class parlor sometimes featured variety and burlesque actresses with whom the song was associated. Men in middle-class households could also possess less respectable images of the same women, because less decent images of these actresses were circulated by photographers, the actresses themselves, and via advertising placed in the pages of men's sporting newspapers. Beginning with images that appeared on sheet music suitable for parlor performance, I will examine a number of images of burlesque and variety actresses active during the 1870s and 1880s in order to explore the ways that sexualized images that were the exclusive province of men co-existed with, and could be intensified by, images of the same actresses that were safe for a middle-class family setting. I will also examine the ways that performance details, including musical features and performance context, complicate assumptions about the appeal these women held for the men in their audiences as well as prevailing assumptions about the performance skills possessed by these women. This more nuanced view allows us to see differences between working-class and higher-class audiences more clearly, as well as locating the shared desires of American men regardless of class.","Gendered Knowledge: Commercial Photographic Images Of Actresses And The Production Of Desire"

It highlights the potential and limits of the multiracial coalitions of the 1970s and 1980s and the turn to electoral politics as the primary vehicle of African American empowerment 100 years after it was first tried. Scholars and journalists routinely attribute Washington’s electoral triumph and brief success as mayor to personal charisma, the rise of independent black political power, and the Democratic machine’s leadership vacuum after the death of Mayor Richard J. Daley. While all true, this framing too often narrates Washington’s story as exceptional to Chicago rather than one increasingly illustrative of national political trends. By looking at both long-term development of neighborhood coalitions around worker rights, housing, community-police relations, and economic development, I argue that the Washington moment and movement reflected two countervailing forces that shaped urban politics for a generation, and in certain ways echoed a previous politics from the 19th century: a real but fragile black political empowerment consistently hemmed in by shifting economic forces, violence, and white political opposition.

The story forms a poignant example of inter-imperial exchange and learning between the colonial tropics of the American and Japanese empires.  This paper uses a food commodity as a way to illuminate complex entanglements of U.S. and Japanese tropical colonialisms with a focus on the agency of Hawaii’s Japanese as indispensable brokers.  After the mid-1920s, a handful of immigrant intermediaries facilitated the transfer of knowledge and technique of modern pineapple farming and canning by re-migrating from America’s insular territory to Japan’s island colony.  These resettlers were self-styled frontier farmers, who viewed the conquest of unexploited land—whether in the United States or in imperial Japan—as being connected to what they described overseas Japanese/racial development.  Having been inspired by U.S. discourse on frontier development, they had maintained psychic and material connections to colonialist endeavors of their homeland as much as they had been committed to the American frontier myth.  And for that very reason, it was not a farfetched proposition for them to re-migrate from Hawaii to Taiwan when circumstances called for such a move.  Following U.S. immigration exclusion of 1924, American racism and invitations by Japan’s colonial regime/capital served as catalysts to the return migration of these immigrant pineapple experts to the home empire, as they came to feel white-dominated Hawaii no longer offered possibilities for their racial development.

This deep and generously funded interest in women around the world was quite remarkable, in these years before the emergence of the modern feminist movement in the US and before any official international interest in women and development. This paper contributes a valuable perspective from the global South to the emerging field of gendered histories of the Cold War and the impact of public diplomacy. At the same time, by paying special attention to East Pakistan (known as Bangladesh since independence in 1971), this paper complicates the nationalist narratives and nation-state-centric narratives of both Pakistan and Bangladesh. While histories of Pakistan have tended to privilege what was then West Pakistan, histories of Bangladesh have tended to work within a linear and teleological nationalist narrative that, with the exception of a few recent projects, has ignored the Pakistan era of 1947-1971. The paper draws on the archives of the relevant US organizations as well as cultural, social, and political archives from East Pakistan—such as periodicals, memoirs, and development and activist organization literature, and oral histories. The result is a more nuanced picture of the encounters between women from the United States and East Pakistan, who are more fully situated in the larger national and transnational contexts within which they wrote and struggled for change.

Although manufacturers first imagined Puerto Rico as a consumer market, they realized it had a tradition of fine needlework that was quickly appropriated for the purposes of industry.  Enterprises in that national industry already functioned as components of a global operation and recognized Puerto Rican needleworkers as a pool of skilled labor easily calibrated to their fluctuating needs.  In the early 1900s, Puerto Rican needleworkers labored at piecework in homes and sweatshops on the island and also migrated to the mainland where they labored in various ways in northeastern factories, sweatshops, and mills.From the 1920s to the 1970s, U.S. agencies, Puerto Rican government offices on the island and mainland, and textile and garment enterprises collaborated to recruit and distribute Puerto Rican needleworkers throughout the Northeast.  Older northeastern factories and mills hired Puerto Rican women workers, who constituted much of the labor until closures in the late-1980s.  During those decades, Puerto Rican women participated in the migrations, created their own chains of communication and support, and joined unions.  At the same time, the State Department used Puerto Rico as an example of export-oriented industrialization for Third World countries.  Despite a dominant historical narrative of straightforward relocation and deindustrialization, this paper exposes a much more complex history.Contrary to popular understandings of American capitalism, enterprises did not relocate in a direct line from North to South to Global South, nor did they propel an advancement of wages and work conditions.  Diverse labor practices existed simultaneously, providing enterprises with a catalogue of options for their ongoing reconfigurations.  Connecting the history of Puerto Rican needleworkers to the larger history of the textile and garment industry revises the historiography and makes visible both the women workers and mechanisms of global capitalism.  In this approach, capitalism functions as an ever-changing mesh rather than as a progressive economic system.  The mesh involves strands of shipping, migration, information and technology, finance, raw material extraction, ports, banks, manufacturing, and border controls.  Enterprises and laborers navigate those fluctuating strands and respond to changing trade agreements, environmental and labor regulations, technologies, and currencies. Common conceptual and historiographical divisions between women’s, labor, U.S., and Caribbean histories have obscured the connections Puerto Rican needleworkers have with older northeastern factories and mills.  Historians have missed evidence vital to understanding the intensification of neoliberal political and economic projects during the late-twentieth century.  Those neoliberal projects relied not only on abstract theories from economists like Friedrich von Hayek and the Mont Pelerin Society, but also on the pragmatic scaffolding of policies and practices developed with Puerto Rican needleworkers. U.S. government and corporate experiments with sovereignty, citizenship, offshore manufacturing, insular exemptions, and the managed migrations of Puerto Rican women fostered that scaffolding.","Homework, Sweatshops, Factories, And Mills: Puerto Rican Needleworkers And A Deep History Of Neoliberalism"

In particular, I foreground housing segregation in order to examine Black women writers’ commentary on spaces of architectural violence. If as Dorothy Hamer Denniston notes--that in Black literature, it is the imagery of architecture [that] especially cements the novel together— then the ways in which the architecture of the home conceals and silences its inhabitants is a useful metaphor for thinking of the design of public housing and tenement buildings as well as the kinds of physical and nonphysical injuries that packing bodies into tight spaces have also caused. These commentaries by Black women help illuminate the health politics of urban Black women writers providing a deeper, intersectional understanding of what housing and health security looks like for women and girls.","How Architecture Produces Black Activist Movements And Redesign In Urban Planning"
"<h5><i>Professor Chris A. Rasmussen (Fairleigh Dickinson University)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2018-04-12</h5><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 14:45 to 16:15</h5><p><h5><b>Id:</b> 2642</h5><p>Historians have typically considered the counterculture an almost exclusively white phenomenon and drawn sharp boundaries between its escapism and the political engagement of the black freedom struggle and antiwar movement. It is true that the thousands of young people who flocked to Haight Ashbury and Greenwich Village in the 1960s were overwhelmingly white. As one black observer asked, How many black hippies do you see? This paper relies principally on black publications (Ebony, Jet, Freedomways, the Chigago Defender) to argue that the counterculture, Civil Rights movement, and Black Power intersected at many junctures. True, some black nationalists despised hippies, and some hippies could not fathom the Civil Rights movement’s desire for inclusion in a society they claimed to reject. But the black freedom struggle powerfully influenced the cultural upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s, and blacks played a significant role in it. As historian Sherry Smith perceptively observes in her study of hippies and American Indians, the social and political movements of the 1960s and 1970s were very much intercultural and interracial. A detailed examination of the affinities and tensions between hippies and blacks, and between the counterculture and black culture, reveals a varied and complicated relationship. There was no single countercultural position on racial issues, and no single black response to the counterculture. White hippies exhibited a wide range of attitudes toward other cultures and races, ranging from an overwhelming faith in love and universal human brotherhood and sisterhood to outright racism. Hippies chose to become outsiders from society, and so imagined that they shared some commonality with black Americans. On the other hand, because they dropped out of American society, many hippies scoffed at the Civil Rights movement’s effort to gain inclusion in the mainstream of American life. Blacks’ responses to the counterculture also ranged from contempt to outright embrace. Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. urged Americans to pay attention to the hippies’ alienation and endorsed their belief in the power of love. Some black nationalists reviled the counterculture, but other considered vital in the effort to topple the Establishment. Stokely Carmichael dismissed hippies as affluent dilettantes who would soon return to the confines of middle-class life, but Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver hailed the hippies’ cultural rebellion as more vital than the New Left’s political challenge to the System. African-American culture, style, and especially music were all affected by the counterculture’s innovation and experimentalism. If few blacks became tie-dyed, sandal-wearing hippies, many black Americans embraced some elements of the counterculture’s styles and values. Drug use, new fashions, and the psychedelic soul and funk music of Sly Stone and George Clinton all contributed to what might be termed a black counterculture.","How Many Black Hippies Do You See?

The government of Hungary saw the extent of transatlantic migration as a crisis, which required action at home and abroad. The Hungarian government’s attempts at restriction went hand-in-hand with other efforts to keep migrants loyal while they are in the United States. The government also sought to profit financially from the migration that it did allow. These three methods of migration management were all intertwined, and all extremely controversial. The paper will examine the main causes and features of restriction legislation, particularly the Emigration Law of 1903. The paper will also examine responses to the law, especially critiques related to the financial collusion between certain members of the Hungarian government and companies that provided migrant services. Hungarian emigration restriction highlights issues of ethnic nationalism and population engineering, economic modernization and changing labor demands, and corruption, as well direct conflict with the U.S. Bureau of Immigration.","Hungarian Emigration Law Of The Early 20Th C.: Rationale, Controversies, And Responses"

This search for resources in the Amazon during the nineteenth century became a common practice by countries such as the United States that saw an opportunity in the recent independence of Latin American countries to establish economic and political relationships with these new nations. The northern Upper Amazon region of Peru was identified as an area that had many resources to offer to these trade-oriented countries. The narratives from these scientific expeditions coming from the United States reflect the travelers’ perceptions about what the Amazon could offer to their own countries’ future political and economic interests. On one hand, the Amazon region awakened the interest of world powers as a potential source of raw materials, but access to the resources and the people relied upon the rivers. On the other hand, the Peruvian state encouraged the outsiders’ exploration of the Amazon and its resources in order to attract foreign immigration, technological knowledge, and external investment. In both situations, political elites expected to gain something by identifying the opportunities inherent in the Amazon. Although the narratives display much about the Upper Amazon as a landscape ripe for commodification, this paper aims to transcend that analysis and examine this particular part of the Amazon region itself.

Schools had long been the most important Catholic institutions in Black urban communities. Inner city parochial schools increasingly faced closure in the 1970s as the white Catholics who once supported them continued to move to the suburbs, fleeing Black migrants and enticed by federal subsidies. Catholic dioceses ostensibly faced the dilemma of whether ‘Catholic’ money should be used to educate ‘non-Catholic’ children. But the NOBC recognized a racially coded dimension in this diagnosis. When Catholic officials say that there will be Catholic schools ‘where parishes can pay for them,’ the statement noted, they are stating obliquely that there will be Catholic schools in the white community. Black Catholics criticized what they took to be the Church’s divestment from Black communities and simultaneous investment in white ones. This paper will focus on conflicts between white and Black Catholics over schooling in 1970s. It will seek to illuminate the lived religious experiences on both sides of this debate – Black Catholics who argued that the gospel called on the Church to educate the impoverished regardless of their religious affiliation as well as white Catholics who fiercely resisted attempts by dioceses to do so. While scholars of Catholicism often view racism as a personal moral failing, not as a problem systemic to the Church, this paper argues that white Catholics and the Catholic Church made material investments white supremacy","Investing In Whiteness: Race And The Catholic Schools Crisis Of The 1970S"

But in the mid-19th century United States, social transformations including urbanization and industrialization contributed to an increase in the popularity of treatments that purported to harness the esoteric and natural qualities of Indian medicine. From patent medicine advertisements to home health manuals, Indian images, names, and likenesses abounded. One aspect of this phenomenon that has received little scholarly attention is the rise of Indian doctresses as a professional class. These Native and non-Native women capitalized on shifting popular cultural understandings of race and gender to heal or counsel others and to make a living. Many Indian doctresses specialized in providing gynecological or obstetric care (including abortions), while others provided a full range of medical services, treating chronic ailments and serious diseases, or worked as fortune tellers. Although they were a part of the broader botanic medicine movement, this paper argues that particular perceptions about Native women contributed to the rise of Indian doctresses as urban entrepreneurs in the 19th-century United States. The study uses newspapers, reform literature, and criminal records to highlight notable Indian doctresses in the 1840s-1870s and examine the intersection of popular cultural ideas about indigenous womanhood and mid-century trends in medicine and social reform. In so doing, it contributes to both the history of medicine, which has focused largely on formally trained women doctors rather than irregular practitioners, and labor history, which still too often ignores Native people.","Irregular Women: Indian Doctresses And American Medicine, 1840-1880"

Historians have seen her fantastic success in the realm of contraception and abortion as paradigmatic of the commercialization of sex in the middle decades of that century. Her notoriety also made her a target for reformers like Anthony Comstock, who ultimately proved to be her undoing. While Restell was arrested numerous times and spent more than a year in jail for the crime of abortion (after New York had criminalized it), she was also the subject of rumors and investigations for a variety of other crimes, kidnapping and child murder among them. In 1846, for instance, Mary Applegate accused her of delivering her child and then promptly taking it from her, never to be returned. In this paper, I take up the these stories to argue that in order better to understand the outrage over abortion, we must focus on the growing sacralization of childhood in the nineteenth century. The kidnapping rumors served to highlight understandings of abortion as the termination of a potential child’s life. Restell also symbolized what supposedly went wrong when young girls were allowed freedom and independence in a growing metropolis: they were sexually exploited. Parental authority was undermined when irregulars like Restell provided what seemed like an easy solution to unwed pregnancy. In short, using the lens of childhood this paper offers a new way of understanding the outrage over abortion in the mid-nineteenth century.","Kidnapping, Child Murder, And The Notorious Madame Restell"

This project investigates why such populist plans instead gave way to a nationwide mania for large-scale land speculation, which in the 1780s and 90s funneled millions of acres into the hands of a revolutionary elite eager to profit off the expansion of a republican empire of liberty.","Land Mania And State Formation In The Revolutionary American Republic"

A leader in this effort was George Ballis, an activist and photographer from the Central Valley.As editor of the Valley Labor Citizen newspaper, Ballis documented the plight of migrant farmworkers, and was credited with helping to bring Chavez to national attention. Ballis led the National Land for People Movement in a water war against corporate farms, believing that while unionization for farmworkers was worthwhile, ultimately the balance of power remained unequal. Ballis saw water reclamation as a way of alleviating the poverty and suffering of migrant farmworkers and restoring the balance of power. Through breaking up large landholdings and redistributing them (along with the water rights) to the people who worked the land, Ballis envisioned radical realignment that addressed issues of food security in a way that contemporary critics of food deserts have all but ignored.In many ways the current water crisis in California has its roots in the failed dream of Ballis and the National Land for People Movement. The NLP has received scant attention from historians and is often treated as a curious, even utopian attempt to stave off water-hungry corporate farms. I suggest, however, that NLP provided the most realistic solution to California’s problem with agribusiness and that the movement’s failure ultimately turned the tide in favor of large-scale corporate farms.

A Welsh émigré, Evans was a geographer who traversed North America in order to produce a map, a map that would go on to be one of the most widely circulated images of the eighteenth century. A General Map of the British Middle Colonies, published in 1755, was the culmination of several years of work for Evans and his collaborator, Thomas Pownall. Their efforts, initially focused on producing cartographic works to assist in the French and Indian War, steadily evolved into a commercial and political production. A General Map and its companion essays were unique in their attentiveness to representing indigenous sovereignty, while also providing the first record of petroleum. Yet what this map also did was claim a copyright.In this paper I argue that A General Map was the first copyright in America. While the current scholarship importantly notes that literary property was not considered legitimate in the colonies – only an English person on English soil could claim it – Evans sought to copyright his map in Philadelphia. While A General Map was one of the most pirated texts of the late colonial period, Evans’ efforts, decades before the first recognized copyright in 1782, were a deliberate political move to protect the representation of his work. The copyright debate surrounding A General Map was pivotal in early national attention to intellectual property, particularly in the passage of the first comprehensive law in 1790.","Lewis Evans, Copyright, And The Creation Of Borders In Early America"

In 1977, Betsy Beaven, Selma Miriam, Samm Stockwell, and Pat Shea—the Bloodroot Collective—opened Bloodroot feminist restaurant and bookstore in Bridgeport, Connecticut. From their strictly vegetarian menu to their communal operations, the Collective intended to live out their lesbian feminist ethics daily. McGrath examines the Bloodroot Collective and the oppositional lives they cultivated inside their experimental establishment. The Bloodroot’s history is the history of late-twentieth-century radical lesbian feminism in action. That narrative contains the mid-century awakening of a group of white middle-class women, who rejected social convention for the counter-normative unknown. It contains radical feminism’s 1970s-1980s apex, when Bloodroot restaurant was part of a national network of creativity and intense communalism. It contains the down-right exhaustion inherent to living ideologically. It also contains turn-of-the-twenty-first-century challenges, by women of color and queer and transgender critics, to the house that lesbian feminism built. She concludes that woman-centered organizations like Bloodroot, while politically limited, preserved oppositionality and cultural innovation in the post-Sixties era. Lesbian feminist businesses are a noteworthy piece of America’s radical history and object lessons in the possibilities and pitfalls of politics expressed through living the revolution.","Living Feminist: Alternative Business And Radical Lesbian Ethics At Bloodroot Restaurant"

These efforts to enact residential segregation were relatively unsuccessful; the state Supreme Court nullified the Winston ordinance a few years after its passage, and the Senate voted against the rural segregation amendment.  This paper explores how North Carolinians came up with the notion of segregating neighborhoods by race.  It investigates why some people thought to apply the idea of segregating public space to private residences.  It looks, too, at residential segregation laws in other states and other countries (such as South Africa), which proved inspirational to segregationists in North Carolina.  This paper ties on-the-ground residential segregationist efforts in the state to a larger movement on the part of segregationists around the globe.  At the same time, it looks at what was specific to the state, including the fact that small white farmers there were able to assert their interests against those of the planter class, a rare occurrence after the defeat of the Populist Party.  Residential segregation in N.C.—in both Winston and the countryside—was not supported by the state’s elites, who thought that this type of segregation would make it harder for them to access the black workers whose labor they relied on.","Local, Regional, And Global Influences On Residential Segregation Laws In North Carolina"

This process masked U.S. complicity in the overthrow of Hawaii’s sovereign government and ignored the protests of its people by claiming the monarchical government, school system, and local society originated from American missionary influence. As such, U.S. educators sought to craft a commonplace attitude of Americanization as a naturally beneficial and inevitable result of progress. Thus, Hawaii’s past was not the product of Native Hawaiian agency but the result of America’s benevolent civilizing mission.This process of legitimization relied on the belief in American progressivist exceptionalism that presumed the superiority and universal applicability of Euro-American ways over indigenous cultures. The promotion of this America-centric narrative erased Native involvement in Hawaii’s past by revising and elevating American involvement to that of paternal benevolence. It also dismissed and suppressed the opposition of local groups to educators’ plans of constructing a national identity by labeling them as old, backward-looking, and un-American. Accomplishing this required prioritizing universal American principles of democracy, citizenship, and the English language in local schools in order to establish dominance over the specific interests of parents, students, and their community. This helped create a simplified standard of identity dismissive of alternative social and cultural realities and necessary for promoting national unity and public cohesion.Essential to spreading and naturalizing this narrative was the public school system. Schools represented efficient and effective sites for transmitting and exposing students to schoolmen’s standardized historical message of what made Hawaii American. This benevolence however did not exist in a vacuum. Alongside their idealism, white educators imported and inserted American attitudes on race into the school system and recreated the very conditions of inequality and structures of school segregation they claimed to reject. Thus the process of democratizing also led to the racializing of Hawaii.Despite this paradox, white schoolmen remained unfazed. In speeches, articles, and pamphlets examined from 1900 to 1940, they preached their obsessive belief in the inherent Americanness of Hawaii. They also broadcasted to the nation and territory the same message used by U.S. imperialists justifying territorial annexation: that Hawaii’s American character was not an accident but part of the deliberate genius of American leadership. To affirm this view, this paper argues white educators implemented a complex educational strategy blending continental attitudes on race, Americanization, and citizenship to produce a campaign of erasure affirming Hawaii was, and always had been, American. Their pedagogical crusade intended to justify American occupation and control of the islands by constructing and disseminating a consistent and convincing narrative that repackaged clear examples of Hawaii’s independent indigenous past as products of America’s benevolence and commitment to progress. Hawaii was always destined to become American; its people just did not know it yet.

Scholars, whether taking a positive or negative view of the resultant Dominion of New England, have consistently viewed it as a brief era centralization later undone by political events across the Atlantic. This paper examines Andros’ land policy in Maine, which involved using maps as administrative tools, to suggest that such centralization actually unfolded at a plodding pace. Moreover, it depended upon local intermediaries who used their connections to the surveyor to acquire land and consolidate their own power in town politics. In other words, centralization paradoxically strengthened certain kinds of parochial powers. At the same time that Andros hoped to use maps to delineate boundaries between landholders, he also used them to mark boundaries between the English and French in America. In examining a corpus of petitions, deeds, correspondence, and maps, I show that this moment of boundary making and contestation ultimately contributed to revolt and warfare—rebuking the interpretation that these events had their genesis in Europe. Finally, this paper considers how archives have organized and preserved these maps in ways that shape how scholars can interpret them—in a broader sense helping us to understand why opposing interpretations of the Dominion have both adopted the same set of incorrect assumptions.","Maps, Petitions, And Boundaries During The Dominion Of New England, 1686-89"

Some faced additional hardship in meeting citizenship requirements and deadlines.  Especially for boys and men, as the U.S. entered World War II, registration for military services was crucial.  For those who reached draft age, failure to register or absence from the U.S. lead to questioning of their U.S. citizenship.         Citizenship troubles not only concerned the U.S.-born repatriates but also their Mexican-born children entitled to U.S. citizenship under jus sanguinis rule.  Acquisition and retention of jus sanguinis citizenship, however, was far more difficult than jus soli citizenship. Citizen-parent’s sex, and residency requirement of the parents for passing on U.S. citizenship and of the children for retaining their U.S. citizenship were some of the key conditions that families had to fulfill and prove.   As the U.S. tightened its border control in the 1950s, suspicion of U.S. immigration authorities on citizenship claims added to the troubles of Mexican-American families.

Notably, as New Deal historians have pointed out, the FLSA included occupational bans that excluded African Americans, women, and poor whites from its protections. The law also banned child labor nationwide. This study will shed light on another group adversely impacted by the FLSA: resident and migrant Mexican American, agricultural child laborers in the Southwest. This study will explore how the exemptions built into the FLSA’s child labor ban facilitated farm owners’ evasion of protective practices. While farm owners were helping to shape the state’s ambivalence about the welfare of Mexican American child laborers, a discourse of racial liberalism that applied to all agricultural child laborers without adequate access to the right to childhood emerged.Few updates have been made to the child labor ban of the 1938 FLSA. In fact, in 2011, then-Department of Labor Secretary, Hilda Solis, proposed revisions to child labor regulations in the U.S. to protect young agricultural workers. In 2012, President Barack Obama scrapped Secretary Solis’ proposed revisions. Today, an estimated 500,000 minors work on farms. With many being foreign-born, undocumented, and of Latino descent, this paper will explore how historical analyses of the FLSA and its marginalization of foreign and domestic-born Latino agricultural child laborers might inform current policy discussions at the intersection of immigration, labor, and childhood.

Termed migrant psychosis, this scientifically-framed malady was offered as a formal diagnosis of the homesickness that recent arrivals felt for countries of origin and the families left, and their alienation from U.S. culture and society. This diagnosis, however, was not evenly applied; rather, it was largely used to treat the illnesses of Mexican im/migrants and other stoop laborers and laborers of color. These im/migrants alone were psychologically unable to adjust to the demands of a modern U.S. culture and society; they were diagnosed as unassimilable. As I argue, migrant psychosis was part of the larger set of political, anthropological, social scientific, politico-economic racialization narratives; im/migrants were to be perennial outsiders to the body politic.Based on evidence from psychology and psychiatry textbooks, in tandem with oral histories of im/migrants and doctors’ notes and case files, the paper explores the work this diagnosis did to broaden the conceptualization and understanding of im/migrants as psychologically underdeveloped, dependent on others, and ill-prepared for political, social, and cultural integration into U.S. society. The scientific discourse about im/migrants that such diagnoses reflect, I argue, contributed to a continued racialization of im/migrant labor and the configuration of certain groups of im/migrants whose affective links to home cultures put them outside the bounds of the nation.

Within the Army, in particular, members evolved from a force of primarily bachelor soldiers to one centered on the nuclear family ideal.  This paper will examine the Cold War origins of the modern family focus in the U.S. military.  The rise in family aid programs, marriage training for future wives of officers and enlisted men, and the promotion of the military family in media help to frame the events within their Cold War context as part of the broader struggle of capitalism and democracy over communism.  The American military family is simultaneously a model of American cultural identity while existing almost as its own unique subculture.  Distinctions of class and race play an important part in this modelling of culture, especially when considering the differences in the policies and promotion of family within the officer and enlisted corps.  By exploring this diversity within the early Cold War promotion of military family, I will show how the institution sought to model itself for the world.  Research at the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center, U.S. Army Women’s Museum, and the West Point Archives and Oral History center inform the research for this paper.","Model Behavior: The American Military Family And The Cold War"

From early in its history, the Shaker movement issued a sharp challenge to the American mainstream by promoting a set of social and spiritual values so radical as to be alien to American identity itself. With the passage of time, however, many of those distinctive Shaker values have been widely reassessed by outsiders as precursors to changes that American society was itself destined to eventually embrace.  Ironically, while Shaker communities contracted (but never disappeared) in the early 20th century, new waves of utopian communities grew in America that purported to draw from vital aspects of Shaker thought and practice, even while the nature of Shaker practice remained veiled and even obfuscated. This paper will examine how idealizing specific features of Shaker life has led to the creation of a dubious archetype for American utopian societies in the 20th century and beyond.","Mother Of All Utopias?

Leaving aside the obvious questions and answers about the accuracy of these fashionable worn and performed histories, I consider instead the confusion that academic history faces when it encounters a history organized not on the level of facts or objectivity, but on the level of feelings, bodies, amateurs. Post-structuralist, post-positivist historiographers have long pointed out that history’s science of facts is illusory, itself a matter of faith as much as any historical modes objective history sought to displace, but affective and embodied histories, such as those enacted through heritage fashions remain hard to evaluate by the standards of academic historiography. From my position at the border of history and performance studies, I plan to articulate the role of the hipster body as a form of history itself.

Today, the term humanism is most often associated either with scientific rationalism (secular humanism) or assumptions about a universal human nature, which are disputed by postmodern thinkers.  In the early twentieth century, however, humanist projects often encapsulated broad-ranging programs of cultural and social renewal that attempted to meet the perceived moral and spiritual needs of modern people.  Looked at now, these multifarious humanist movements cast the fissures in contemporary American intellectual life into stark relief.One such fissure divides secular from religious thinkers.  Some humanists saw themselves as transcending this divide and overcoming the limitations of both theology and philosophy.  The University of Pittsburgh philosopher Oliver L. Reiser provides a case in point.  In the 1930s, Reiser joined a group of Unitarian ministers, unorthodox religious thinkers, scientists, and Deweyan thinkers to publish the Humanist Manifesto in 1933, a plea for a liberal, non-theistic religion.  In the following years, many moved on to a scientific and naturalistic humanism shorn of the earlier religious pretensions, however, Reiser soldiered on, eventually propounding a cosmic humanism.  By the 1960s and 1970s he attached himself to various projects that might fulfill the project of global integration and spiritual transcendence, including Project Prometheus based on global satellite communications as the means to further the understanding of the idea of mankind; the Committee for the Future’s synergistic conference, or SYNCON, featuring the creation of a SYNCON wheel; and The Cooperators, a consortium aiming to create a map of the world.  By the 1960s, Reiser had become a living connection between different eras of spiritual aspiration and an emblem of an older tradition of public philosophy.","Oliver L.

This dialogic project of building an employable biography both bridged differences in perception and also seeded a new exchange value for biographic data. Meyer Bloomfield, Parsons’ successor, collected data in area high schools to generate new statistical arguments about available labor pools and the suitability of graduates for advanced training. The coordinated transfer of data and selective employment of graduates shaped a conception of human capital that economized biographic data into life trajectories worthy of investment.","On The Uses Of Personal History: From Vocational Counseling To Human Capital"

Charged with organizing Mexican Americans in East Los Angeles, he developed an activist strategy that pushed the state at all levels to recognize them as political subjects.  He made some headway.  Investing in the political process as a strategy to further inclusion and rights, the multi-racial—though largely Mexican American—CSO developed effective organizing strategies that helped make Mexican Americans a prominent constituency in California’s postwar political landscape.  This paper examines CSO organizing goals and strategies in relationship to the broader terrain of alternative political projects.  It draws on archival collections and popular press to illustrate the ways that Ross emphasized particular narratives of Mexican American history in the recent past to justify inclusion: military service, labor, anti-communism. In doing so, the CSO both pushed boundaries of national inclusion while overlooking opportunities to participate in alternative political projects aligned across national boundaries.Scholarship on Mexican American political activism and on the long and wide civil rights movement recognizes the CSO’s role in the state’s inclusionary expansion. Yet the CSO’s discursive strategies, designed to both foster Mexican American community activism and gain recognition, also reveal the seduction of the existing liberal democratic political project and the limits to alternative framings of pluralist political spaces and projects.","Organizing For Activism: The Community Service Organization And The Liberal State"

The group, spanning from Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New Mexico organized Mexican American, Asian American, and African American workers to establish cross-racial coalitions that would then utilize the readings of Karl Marx, Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, and Vladimir Lenin to create a worker’s revolution within the United States. The major question this study seeks to explore is why the ATM’s political trajectory during the global Cold War created the notion that it was the vanguard party to lead United States workers of different ethnic backgrounds for social change? The first half of this paper explores the ATM as an organization constantly seeking to create multi-racial coalitions, or what Jeffrey Ogbar has termed rainbow radicalism, with the Black Panther Party of the Black Power Movement, I Wor Kuen of the Asian American Movement, and Amiri Baraka’s Congress of Afrikan People. The second half will explore the merging of the ATM, IWK, and CAP in 1978 to form the multiracial communist organization known as the League of Revolutionary Struggle.The members of the ATM conducted mass organizing work in factories, farms, and against the Bakke decision that banned affirmative action in 1978. They also produced joint newspapers with other groups while providing translations of group polemics for one another so that they could reach workers of different ethnic backgrounds. An analysis of the ATM’s major union activism highlights their difficulties organizing undocumented workers, Spanish-speaking workplaces, Chinese-speaking workplaces, and factories with different racial demographics. The strikes create an opportunity for historians to analyze how social movement groups crossed racial lines to support worker’s struggles. LRS, as this paper will argue, represents a multiracial coalition based on the Marxist canon and also shows the long political life trajectories of activists from identity based movements of the 1960s and 1970s. This paper will confront how the representation of race and class via Marxist-Leninist activists still needs to be addressed by historians. It will also provide commentary on the theoretical debates presented by activists who utilized the Marxist canon as a form of theory and praxis. The tension between having political classes and organizing workers, I argue, makes the LRS a key organization for understanding how the activism of the 1970s changed over time into the 1990s.","Organizing Multiracial Workplaces: The Activism Of The League Of Revolutionary Struggle 1974-1991"

Municipal officials, who faced constrained budgets as the city’s property tax bases declined, struggled with how best to respond to the panic over crime. This paper examines how in reaction to the perceived inadequacies of governmental responses to crime, New Yorkers began to launch their own anti-crime initiatives. By the early 1970s, city dwellers had formed well over one hundred resident-led neighborhood patrols and anti-crime community groups.The proliferation of these grassroots efforts, this paper argues, helped facilitate major expansions in government and private sector responses to crime, ones that historians have commonly depicted as resulting overwhelmingly from the actions of elites and powerful officials. For one, the thousands of community members who began taking a more active role in crime prevention formed a powerful and increasingly organized constituency that demanded more punitive government responses to crime, including increased policing and harsher sentencing. At the same time, their emphasis on the supposed need to supplement municipal policing helped facilitate the development and expansion of private security forces. Private sector funded patrols formed throughout business districts in the late 1970s and 1980s, joining the citizen-led patrols in residential areas. Everyday New Yorkers, this paper therefore argues, helped to spur both increased criminalization and the private sector’s expanded role in policing during the final decades of the twentieth century.","Patrolling The Neighborhood:  Citizen Responses To Crime In 1970S New York"

Planters, for example, studied chemists such as Francis Home and Count Rumford to improve making manure from the waste of enslaved people and livestock, and to feed both slaves and animals calculated diets of fodder. Moreover, planters began studying global experiments in planting crops, especially sugar and wheat, as far afield as Scotland, Egypt, and India, and began understanding plantership through the lens of global ecological and climatic patterns. Through scientific societies, planters experimented with new improvements for harnessing, quantifying, and improving the energetic potential of slaves and animals, which they termed the nerves and sinews of plantations. In farm books, manuals, and printed treatises, planters quantified the energy of enslaved Africans and livestock, computing how much dung could be accumulated from either, and how much muscle-power each provided on the plantation. In doing so, they seamlessly knit African slavery into the ideology of improvement and political arithmetic, and networks of global exchanges in scientific information. Using case studies from Barbados and Virginia, I argue that by the end of the eighteenth century, planters in both regions embraced the scientific identity of enlightened European experimentalists, while retaining the classical ideal of the virtuous husbandman and paternal slaveholder.","Plantation Nerves And Sinews: Science And Slaveholding In Barbados And Virginia, 1765-1800"

This presentation maps this activity through arrest records and by following the daily habits of African American women policy workers. The quotidian fabric of policy procedures—how to place a bet, how to pick up money, where to drop money, how to spin a wheel, what a station looked and felt like—contrasted with more sobering tensions faced by Black working women. Arrest and the possibility of jail time were lived realities for of these women, who even in the worst of times had to make sure there was dinner on the table. These rhythms and realities in the lives of policy employees unfolded across Chicago’s dynamic landscape, providing a gendered geography of Black women’s working and domestic space. My paper examines what African American women during the Great Depression shared as writers, clerks, and runners as well as how these diverse occupations led to vastly different experiences in policy industry. Their narratives reflect the widespread importance of meeting their children’s needs and the value of their relationships with one another across time and space, but also how the precariousness of the labor made them vulnerable to law enforcement. I conclude that work in the policy industry demanded simultaneous visibility and invisibility, an impossible task.","Policy Gambling As Black Women’s Work And Black Women’s Space"

During the course of these investigations, HUAC infamously accused Hollywood writers, directors, and actors of communism, leading to a blacklist colloquially known as the Hollywood Ten, who were denied employment in the entertainment industry for many years. However, long before HUAC blacklisted these entertainers, the Dies Committee, the predecessor of HUAC, also targeted the entertainment industry. The Dies Committee, formed in 1937 to investigate Fascism in the United States, instead turned its attention to Communism. In particular, the committee focused on attempting to expose communists in the Roosevelt administration. During the course of these widely publicized hearings, the Dies Committee investigated the Federal Theater project, and other Hollywood entertainers, including then 10-year-old Shirley Temple. In so doing, the Dies Committee politicized entertainment, and paved the way for the serious accusations and blacklists that would follow more than ten years later. The focus of this paper will be on the Dies Committee’s investigations of the entertainment industry, and American reactions to those hearings.","Politicizing Entertainment: The Dies Committee Investigations, 1938-1941"

Fifties adolescence often represented a pre–Vietnam War, pre–civil rights movement, pre–women’s liberation American innocence. In this paper, I build on the existing scholarship around nostalgia, culture, and memory to analyze pregnancy scares and abortion in pop culture and to explore the ways that their portrayal reflected conflicts over gender and sexuality. For example, in both the 1974 film The Lords of Flatbush and the 1978 hit Grease, which depicted romanticized working-class fifties teen greasers, the plots included pregnancy scares. In both films, the scares turned out to be unnecessary: in Lords of Flatbush it was the invention of a girl who wanted to leverage her boyfriend toward marriage, and in Grease, the girl discovered she was not pregnant after all. In the movies, the pregnancy danger—a potentially deadly serious consequence of premarital sex, given the perils of illegal abortion and strictly enforced sexual double standard in the 1950s—simply disappeared. Thus, the messy contests over sex, gender, and reproduction that would be raised by unmarried pregnant teenage girls—the contests so viscerally playing out in American society in the 1970s—were obviated. In other words, one of the main loci for social and political conflict in the 1970s was erased through these nostalgic cultural products that looked back toward a simpler time. These nostalgic productions avoided both the ill will stirred by debates over gender and sex in the 1970s as well as public outcries over depictions of abortion in pop culture, such as the backlash against the 1972 TV show Maude after two 1972 episodes centered on the main character’s decision to have an abortion. At the same time, abortion was becoming a national political issue, one suffused with concerns about history. Abortion politics in the 1970s was deeply imbedded in a politicized cultural obsession with the past, and partisans on all sides of the abortion issue reflected that obsession with rhetorical strategies that sought to justify their positions with historicized appeals. Antiabortion activists often framed their arguments around an appeal to moral traditions rooted in two versions of the past—one a religious past shaped by immutable moral truths, the other a historical tradition of American law. In turn, abortion rights activists reacted to the right to life movement’s appeal to the morally correct recent past by constructing a narrative of temporal progress along with a symbolic specter that would represent the dangers of going back: the potentially lethal back-alley illegal abortion. Both groups’ arguments used the past as a form of political appeal.How did a politics of the past connect these two realms—the political and the cultural? I want to use this forum to explore the ways that visions of the past affected and were influenced by the politics of sex, gender, and abortion in the 1970s.","Pop Culture Nostalgia, Sex, And The Politics Of Abortion In The 1970S"

Frances Kelsey is remembered as the official lionized for delaying the approval of thalidomide. This paper examines her role in the FDA’s effort to define potentially pregnant women as a vulnerable population that was codified in 1977 guidelines. The FDA’s definition of pregnant women was expansive, limiting participation of most women of childbearing potential in clinical trials save the incarcerated. The prohibition had far-reaching implications: with limited information on the impact of drugs on expectant women, most product labels simply stated that safety had not been assessed for pregnant women. Nevertheless, these therapeutic orphans, sometimes had severe illnesses and used prescribed medications despite unknown consequences, effectively creating a new study population. Memorandums circled at the FDA in the 1970s about how to manage these thorny ethical questions. Yet by the 1990s, critics decried exclusionary policies, arguing that they were paternalistic or too restrictive. This presentation details the FDA’s shifting approach to defining potentially fertile women as a vulnerable population in assessments of drug safety, contextualized in broader debates of the period about pregnancy and reproductive autonomy.","Potentially Pregnant: Frances Kelsey And The Post-Thalidomide Construction Of Women Of Childbearing Potential As A Vulnerable Population"

As a result, literature on Civil War prisons and prisoners has traditionally examined the conditions of prisons, the politics and policies that led to so many deaths, and the virulent postwar sectional disputes about wartime culpability for prison casualties. Prisons, however, were also spaces where war uniquely influenced prisoners’ psyches, individually and collectively. They had the time and imperative to write reassuring letters home, comforting loved ones. But because prisons employed censors and imposed page limits to correspondence, prisoners also had to carefully examine both the content and style of what they wrote. The result is a unique epistolary culture in which prisoners and their loved ones created ways to make sense not only out of the events of the war but the meaning of the war itself. This paper explores the influence of prison structures, especially censorship, on this genre of wartime writing. Specifically, it argues that captured soldiers, when they turned inward to write home, as well as in diaries, created the first drafts of what would become the literature of the postwar era and the fodder for renewed sectional conflict precluding meaningful reconciliation for years to come.","Prions Pens: The Culture Of Writing In Civil War Prisons"

The offices of the Free Speech and its destruction, the New York Age, and the exodus from Memphis all illustrate the mutually constitutive role of property and print media in post-emancipation black efforts for racial progress. Although many race newspapers were printed by whites, African Americans increasingly sought to produce and distribute their newspapers in separate spaces. They edited articles in the basements of black churches, opened their own printing presses, and sold copies of their papers in black-owned pharmacies and saloons. In turn, black papers encouraged economic self-help through the acquisition of property. Entire newspapers were dedicated to town boostersim, and articles frequently described the value and architectural details of black properties. Such properties became a ubiquitous aspect of the era’s black visual culture. Historians have considered how portraiture illustrated African Americans’ conceptions of freedom but images of buildings served as equally celebrated representations of black progress.","Property And The Black Press In Jim Crow America"

These policies, as scholars have pointed out, depended heavily on racial discrimination, shaping a post-war landscape that continues to be segregated to this day. Policymakers did not, however, wholly come up with these ideas in the mid-twentieth century. Rather, they codified notions about race, suburbs, and property value that real estate developers had been circulating for decades. This paper uses a public-private neighborhood protection program conducted in Baltimore between 1938 and 1940, along with its aftermath in the 1950s, to examine how during the New Deal a small group of elite white suburban developers negotiated a role in the expanding federal state, facilitating the government’s adoption of older Realtor ideas as common sense. In doing so, this paper also sheds light on why the federal government codified particular forms of housing discrimination.","Protecting The Neighborhood: State-Developer Partnerships And ‘Common Sense’ Ideas About Property Value"

The recent battles over obvious inequality in the City by the Bay – with homeless encampments erected next to luxury apartment towers and gleaming tech headquarters – originated in the 1970s, and punks were on the front lines.  Not only did bands write a long list of songs and anthems condemning landlords, gentrifiers, and police (among others), but punks participated in street battles in defense of evictees, burned police cars the night of the Dan White verdict, and ran their own candidate (Jello Biafra of the band Dead Kennedys) for mayor against Dianne Feinstein.  In the struggle against what David Harvey would call the dispossession of the San Francisco, punks asserted a right to the city and, allied with other citizens and activists, fought to carve out and claim spaces for their communities.  In this way, they followed, not unwittingly, a New Left prefigurative politics model by trying to build a micro-model of a society they hoped to build on a larger scale.  As this paper shows, much of this sense of possibility derived from a sense of San Francisco as a unique laboratory for cultural and political experimentation.  By examining punk history as urban history, this paper recovers the political engagement of an important, if neglected, subculture.","Punk City: San Francisco At The Neoliberal Dawn"

After federal politicians failed to address the matter in the 1790s, individual citizens were left to envision their own solutions for the national problem of slavery. Could the nation continue as a divided political body? The Louisiana Purchase introduced new possibilities, as vast tracks of land theoretically provided regional space for black emancipation and settlement. Colonizationists quickly turned their attention to the West in the hopes of finally solving the slave question.Yet disagreements plagued the proposal from the beginning. White anti-slavery activists who refused to consider assimilation were challenged by black authors who wished to remain in the land they tilled. Southern slaveholders, conversely, argued that the new Louisiana Terrority was prime space for the growing slave institution. And white laborers in the North believed western territories provided necessary free soil for free white labor. How was this new region to be envisioned, let alone settled? This paper uses these debates as a lens through which to understand how Americans conceived regions during the early republic. In an expanding empire with westward ambitions, what role would these new territory play in America’s geopolitical drama? The Mississippi Valley and Midwest, terms that have become synonymous with this land, were the final products of these debates, but they were far from inevitable. Discussions concerning the Louisiana Purchase territory reveals how regions were simultaneously racialized and politicized during an era of expansion.","Racializing Regions: Colonizing Louisiana Territory And The Limits Of Early American Union"

Throughout much of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, sugar was big business along the winding bayous of southeast Texas. There, the fertile soil and tropical-like climate yielded an ample supply of cane that ultimately rivaled the sugar produced domestically in places such as Louisiana and Hawaii, and to some, Texas sugar surpassed Caribbean sugar in terms of its quality. Moreover, this precious commodity also gave birth to numerous capitalist ventures in the region, and for Fort Bend County, Texas, cane production launched the start of a profitable sugar refinery, Imperial Sugar Company, which today, bears the distinction as the state’s oldest extant business enterprise. Though Texas sugar growers never produced the quantity of cane as their Louisiana neighbors, sugar cultivation proved quite lucrative and indeed useful to a state in constant economic distress and swarming in social chaos, either real or imagined. Sugar, furthermore, allowed Texas to dabble in leasing out the state’s swelling convict population to labor-hungry and profit-driven sugar planters from 1871 until 1883. And after a turbulent yet fruitful decade of leasing out its mostly black, male convict population, the state moved to purchase its own massive sugar plantations throughout the so-called Sugar Bowl and reap the financial windfall from the labor of its bound lot. Simply, sugar helped build and sustain the state’s prison system while exacting undue misery on thousands of black men along the way. Furthermore, this paper explores the gendered experiences of black male convicts who exclusively labored on state-owned sugar plantations from the late nineteenth to early twentieth century. By examining how gender shaped the convict’s labor and leisure as a ward of state, this work draws heavily from slavery and masculinity studies to demonstrate the range of masculine models present on prison sugar farms (a homosocial space), and it endeavors to capture a more complex portrait of the black men ensnared in the state’s (in)justice system. Ultimately, this project challenges the assertion that black men endured the incarceration experience in a homogeneous fashion by arguing against an essentialist reading of men altogether and by highlighting the presence of various masculinities within a larger gender system that subordinates and differentiates among men, even under confinement.","Raising Cane, Razing Men: A Gendered View Of The Texas Prison Empire, 1871-1920"

It examines their use of public diplomacy to garner widespread popular support for their efforts both in the U.S. and in Nicaragua to overthrow the Sandinistas.

After two years of deliberations between the War, State, and Justice Departments, the Paperclip specialists were offered a path to U.S. citizenship in 1947 in the national interest. Paperclip therefore marked the first instance in which the federal government and private industry became involved in the enticement and persuasion of foreign scientists to work, through contract, for the United States. In 1948, the Displaced Persons Act included the first immigration policy with conscious labor preferences and job requirements for refugees entering from Europe. The 1952 McCarran-Walter Act further expanded the wartime military logic of Project Paperclip and allocated 50% of all visas to highly skilled professionals. Since then, every successive legal framework governing U.S. immigration has included a quota for the highly skilled.These events signaled the important role that employers would play in future immigration debates and programs.

Yankees, calling themselves pioneers and colonizers, moved to the region in waves throughout the early 20th century and wealthy Northern investors built empires of citrus and sugar. The Indian River Farms Company of Davenport, Iowa made some of the greatest strides toward conquering and reimagining La Florida. While settling the region, the company created a romantic narrative to sell land to potential Yankee colonizers. Street names included Seminole, Osceola, Cherokee, Mohawk, Kickapoo, and Ute. All names considered \"picturesque\" by would be settlers. Arthur McKee and Waldo Sexton were the men most responsible for the vision of Old Florida that the city of Vero Beach lays claim to. McKee built an extensive 80-acre jungle garden where a Seminole man came to live and build a chickee, becoming a part of the entertainment complex. Waldo Sexton, started out by demonstrating farm equipment, went on to scavenge throughout Latin America and the American West for relics of Spanish colonialism, collecting bells and tiles from a number of missions that now dot his many driftwood buildings throughout town.","Remembering Old Florida: Mythmaking And Settler Colonialism"

She began her career performing in minstrel theater, tent shows, and along the chitlin’ circuit of theaters and clubs in black neighborhoods.  By the early 1960s, she would finally achieve broad success with a series of wildly successful comedy albums and a steady stream of television appearances.  Born Loretta Mary Aiken, Mabley was a performer who, through a career in comedy that spanned over 60 years, cultivated and mastered incongruities:  an old woman who on stage openly expressed desire for young men; a lesbian whose assertive and raunchy straight stage persona defined her in the eyes of her adoring audiences; a harmless grandmotherly figure who used her humor to attack Jim Crow as well as sexual proscriptions.  Though seemingly without artifice when on stage, Mabley was a black woman whose life in public concealed the closely protected details of her private life.  In this paper, I will examine the archival and ethical challenges posed by reconstructing this black woman’s life.  In examining these challenges, I will propose a re-examination of the biographical impulse and will explore the formal innovations required to write the many stories of Jackie Moms Mabley.

Historians working in both the U.S. and Mexico documents the perspectives and actions of U.S. and Mexican officials and reveal the experience of those who were repatriated. However, they tend to make arguments relevant to either U.S. or Mexican historiography and focus on Mexicans’ departure from the United States and their arrival and settlement in Mexico. In conversation with new scholarship on repatriation, this paper contributes to earlier work by examining repatriates’ efforts to return to the United States and by thinking critically about the relationship between repatriates and U.S. citizenship. Instead of assuming that citizenship held no value for U.S.-born Mexicans who were repatriated, I demonstrate that citizenship was a site of negotiation. Using archival sources from Mexico and the United States, this paper examines repatriates’ strategies to claim U.S. citizenship and to secure aid from the U.S. government. In claiming U.S. citizenship, repatriates replicated formal political strategies used by migrants, used their transnational familial networks, and echoed New Deal and Depression era discourse, particularly new conceptions of citizenship. By examining repatriates’ claims to U.S. citizenship during the Great Depression, we can gain a better understanding of migrant-state relations, the limits and possibilities of practicing U.S. citizenship in Mexico, and the role of transnational families.","Return Migration During The Great Depression: Citizenship, U.s.-Born Repatriates, And The State"

Utilizing text mining techniques in newspaper databases as well as Geographic Information System (GIS) data, this project tracks the development of the ministerial elopement genre and asks what these ministers were running from and, perhaps more importantly, what they were running toward. The way in which newspapers presented these cases--dwelling on the pastors’ theological hypocrisy and adding a sprinkling of vivid descriptions of the young attractive female parishioners with whom the ministers disappeared--raised questions about sexuality, religious authority, and morality that the press had not considered since the infamous Beecher-Tilton scandal of the mid-1870s. Here, scandal became a test of religious authenticity, and the increasing publicity of elopement cases made mainstream ministers newly vulnerable to secular skepticism and gratuitous scrutiny. This presentation will interrogate the genre of scandal as a form of history and discuss how historians can use digital history tools to present historical phenomena like the rise of religious scandal coverage in the media in new and compelling ways.","Reverends On The Run: Ministerial Elopement Scandals In The Gilded Age Press"

During this period, early works of community history such as \"Nothing Left in My Hands: The Issei of a Rural California Town, 1900-1942\" (1978) and \"Linking Our Lives: Chinese American Women of Los Angeles\" (1984) were based on ideas about knowledge production and dissemination that were generally distinct from those of the traditional field of American history. During a period when the mainstream discipline of history largely promoted the idea that historical research should be directed first at fellow academics before eventually trickling down to a broader public audience, community historians in Asian American studies saw the communities they were working with as the primary audience of their scholarship.  Where as mainstream American historians were concerned primarily with making academic interventions, Asian American community historians were often more concerned with the ways in which documenting the history of Asian American communities could advance the political empowerment of those same communities. Where as traditional American historians tended to be professionals affiliated with universities who worked alone, community historians tended to be Asian American community members without professional training in the field of history who often chose to produce their projects collaboratively. While aspects of this community history ethos remain in the field today, for the most part historians of the  Asian American experience now subscribe to the norms of the discipline of American history. Tracing the genealogy of Asian American community history from its origins in the 1970s and 1980s through the present, this presentation argues that community history is a distinct form of historical inquiry with methods, objectives, and forms that differ from those most dominant in the field of American history. While acknowledging the real benefits that have occurred from the instutionalization and acceptance of Asian American history within American academy, I argue that key aspects of the process of community history as practiced by Asian American studies in the 1970s and 1980s can and should be adopted more readily by scholars of  Asian American history today. Drawing on community history projects that I oversaw during my eight years as a historian at the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California in Los Angeles Chinatown, and also on my dissertation Performing Chinatown: Hollywood, Tourism, and the Formation of a Los Angeles Community, 1931-1949, I demonstrate how the advent of digital tools such as the ease of video recording and digital scanning make adopting aspects of community history’s methods, objectives, and forms that much easier. If publishing primarily for academics in professional journals is the price that Asian American history has paid for its institutionalization within the American academy, then this talk suggests that digital technology can allow scholars to combine the best aspects of community history and institutionalized Asian American history scholarship to produce new forms of Asian American history that speak to the scholarly and political needs of our current moment.

Retailers often determine what is manufactured and by whom, how it is transported, and how much it costs. Retailing has changed American work. Ringing up customers became the new default working-class job in the late twentieth century; by 2015 cashiers and salespersons were the largest U.S. occupations. Yet the jobs were poorly paid, often part-time or temporary, and came with paltry benefits, if any. Women worker were central to retail's ascendance. In fact, by the 1970s the new retail workforce was increasingly young, female and African-American. Nearly three-quarters of sales clerks and 88 percent of cashiers were women, including more African-Americans than ever before. Many of these female retail workers, it turns out, did not back down easily when they faced de-skilling and the gutting of wage and benefits standards that were hallmarks of a neoliberal financialized capitalism. Using evidence from department store and grocery union organizing campaigns and union contracts in the 1970s and 1980s, this paper explores how female sales clerks, cashiers and distribution center workers fought for alternatives to the low-road employment policies that mark the retail workers' experience today.

Both fairs were efforts by city boosters to claim San Francisco’s role as the queen city of the West Coast, if not the Pacific Rim itself.  Local residents who deeply believed in locating California as a Pacific state and in crafting a future for the region with a destiny facing west instead of east, actively shaped both fairs to meet their goals. In 1915, that meant crafting a fair that welcomed the nations of China and Japan, despite domestic anti-Asian sentiment. By 1939, this meant the involvement of the Institute of Pacific Relations, an organization founded to focus on international attention on research and policy-making in the Pacific.  In the 1930s, the flourishing interest nationally and internationally, in culture, and in preserving so-called traditional culture, also lent an important element to the fair, as exhibits celebrated both consumerism and primitivism simultaneously. The result was an image of the Pacific that highlighted the unique cultures and peoples of the region as well as the economic possibilities available to savvy investors, all with the underlying goal of peace in the Pacific, in a distinct difference from the PPIE, which presented a much more dichotomized vision of race and culture. This paper will therefore use visual sources to examine how and why the vision of the city, and its role in the Pacific, changed between 1915 and 1939. Sources such as the fair’s publicity posters and pamphlets, public school curricula, artwork, and exhibits will allow us to discuss just how these massive cultural events help to shape a vision of the Pacific World for the millions of visitors who entered their gates. Who did, and did not, have a voice in constructing these images of the Pacific? What role did San Francisco culture and politics play in shaping the fair’s relationship to the Pacific? Those are the questions this paper will answer in an attempt to understand how the two fairs help us understand both western urban development and national political and economic priorities in the pre-World War II United States.

The people in Lizard’s town planned to steal fire from Eagle, who selfishly kept the fire under his wings.  The people teamed up, stole the fire, and raced with it back to town.  Before they reached their roundhouse (a traditional building in which the people held ceremonies), however, Coyote grabbed the fire, dropped it and set the entire Sacramento Valley ablaze.  Traditionally, scholars have treated oral traditions, such as the story of Lizard, as quaint myths.  This paper argues that oral traditions are an Indigenous version of California’s history and engaged in broader political events of the Great Depression. Concows possessed a visual understanding of the past; when they saw their landmarks they could recall stories about their history. Concows used to claim their indigenousness to California, refuting the efforts of Americans to make themselves first in California. Concows also employed oral traditions to claim the land and places from which the federal government had removed Concows in the 1860s.  McLaine and other Concows referred to landmarks in the Sacramento Valley by their Concow names and with the Concow language.  Finally, oral traditions provided Concows with a path to follow in the future.   Concows could take lessons from their oral traditions, which they could apply to their struggles for sovereignty in the 1940s and 1950s.","Seeing West Mountain: Concow Histories Of California During The Great Depression"

By demonstrating how claimants used these tribunals to question the government’s ability to protect life and property within its borders, the project explains why a key conceptual and institutional framework for American expansion developed at mid-nineteenth century fell apart during the first decades of the twentieth, and considers the legacies of its collapse for the ways the United States would use international law to facilitate its imperial ventures.","Settlement Colonialism In The Long Nineteenth Century And Its Aftermath"

Outside of this legality, there were a number of rape cases and sexual abuses committed, not only by stationed units, but also by the military police, Kempei tai.  This legality of state sponsored sex work was carried onto R.A.A. (Recreation and Amusement Association) in postwar Japan.  It was supposed to have ended when GHQ prohibited it in the early part of 1946.  Nonetheless, wherever American forces were stationed, red light district flourished in different parts of Japan and local administrative units were forced to partake in their maintenance. Here is where the notion of \"state sponsored sex work\" needs rethinking.  Then, when the Korean War started and the 8th Army advanced to Korea, once again the Korean state provided formal \"state sponsored sex work,\" and hence, the notion of Korean comfort women for the U.N forces.

Historians agree that the interrelated concerns of gender and sex were peripheral to most nineteenth-century social experiments, including in the many Fourierist communities founded in the 1840s. Fourierist themselves, especially the movement’s male leaders, vehemently denied that male and female communitarians engaged in any scandalous sexual relationships. In practice, many Fourierists rejected sexual propriety, and they continued to do so long after their communities disintegrated. This paper argues for a continuity of sexual experimentation from the Fourierist heyday of the 1840s through the late nineteenth century. This paper examines the integration of sexual experimentation into American utopianism through the career of Marie Howland, a former Lowell mill girl, writer, and ardent socialist. In the late 1850s, she resided in an urban Fourierist household known as the Unitary Home. In the 1880s, she moved to Mexico to help establish the colony of Topolobampo.

A is Black, B is Jewish, C is Chinese, and so are all of the members of their respective families and kin groups, and so must they remain.  In the American West, there have been many people who have changed identities over the course of their lives, or over generations in families, as they have moved from one social context to another, or as new social rules have been imposed on them.  This is not racial, ethnic, or religious imposture.  It is simply the way that people's lives have unfolded in fluid social circumstances.

Although men almost always outnumbered women in the poor farms of the American Midwest (and elsewhere) women often utilized the poor farm for different reasons than men, both as residents and employees.  With no maternity facilities, women went there to give birth.  With no shelters for abused women, they fled there to get away from dangerous spouses.  With no relatives nearby, women went there with children when they had no home.  With few opportunities for cash wages, many women picked up work at the local poor farm.  With no family member who would allow them a place in their home, older often widowed women went there feeling abandoned and alone.  As employers, poor farms served as economic engines for local women who sewed, cleaned, cooked, and nursed.  From teenagers to widows, women played an important role in providing care and services.  Few poor farms functioned without women working there as matrons, and occasionally women served as superintendents themselves.  Female residents were more likely to be younger and in extreme distress of a temporary nature.  These gendered dynamics expose important distinctions of local social welfare provisions and tell a story of daily institutional life that nuances our understanding of women in rural communities.

Many were persuaded by Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky’s assertion in On the Spiritual in Art (1911) that modern art should be a form of creative transcendence, and that modern artists were compelled by inner necessity toward the spiritual life, to which art belongs.  Aiming to transcend limiting secular, material, and commercial understandings of art, these American moderns looked to religious teachings, symbols, and rituals to forge more spiritually resonant forms of visual and material culture.  They were not religious artists but spiritual seekers: American moderns who doubted mainstream religious dogma, especially the faith traditions in which they had been raised, and explored a multitude of other sacred cultures in their search for self, serenity, and emphatically independent versions of American modernism.  Disaffected by what they perceived as the restrictions of traditional religious belief, spiritual seekers sought mystical experiences that were personally and aesthetically liberating.  Their spiritual modernism represents an important contribution to the history and meaning of twentieth century American art, although critical and curatorial suspicions about faith stemming from secularization theories of modernity have, until relatively recently, prohibited engaged studies of the links between art and belief in modern times.  This paper argues for more efficacious approaches to the cultural work of religion in modern American art.

While it is hard to prove that migration itself caused many suicides, the phenomenon generated extensive and revealing documentation that can shed new light on the old debate over whether immigrants felt uprooted. Some German immigrants who chose death expressed distinctive feelings of discouragement (Entmutigung) and alienation or foreignness (Fremdheit) in suicide notes and in the words and actions later recorded in inquest transcripts and newspaper reports. Other German Americans wrote about suicide in letters, commentaries, and fictional accounts such as Casper Butz’s 1851 poem Heimwehtod (Death from homesickness). They sometimes depicted suicide as a logical way for sensitive Germans to respond to a socially and culturally barren country obsessed with profit. In short, German immigrants embedded suicide in communal understandings of the emotional toll of migration, using an identifiably German language of suffering and relating unbearable anguish to mundane hardships. While suicide remained exceptional, it fit within widely held assumptions about German character, the United States, and migration. This paper takes seriously the sort of emotional turmoil evoked in Susan Matt’s Homesickness (2011) and Oscar Handlin’s The Uprooted (1951), but also incorporates the insights of Handlin’s numerous critics and historians who have studied immigrant community building. I approach emotions culturally, informed especially by Barbara Rosenwein’s work. Ultimately, I conclude, even personal feelings of dislocation can best be understood in the context of the emotional norms of immigrant communities.","Suicide And German-American Emotional Communities"

The seven-seat bar sparked a food trend with white coastal elites and eventually a global craze for raw fish, rice, and sake. But Kawafuku during the 1960s represented the height of the first boom in popularity for a Japanese dish—sukiyaki. Seating hundreds a night, Nakajima served a soy sauce-based hot pot dish of beef, tofu and vegetables first used in Japanese treaty ports during the 1850s to introduce meat into the local diet. Scholars of Japanese culinary globalization have overlooked the transnational circulation and popularization of sukiyaki. In doing so, they have failed to explore the interconnected nature between the formation of immigrant society and the development of pathways of consumption for Japanese food products. Relying on Japanese-language community histories and various Japanese corporate archival sources, I argue that between the 1920s and 1960s sukiyaki served on ocean liners and in Nikkei restaurants was a key culinary practice in shaping American ideas about Japanese culture and tradition. By tracing the spread of sukiyaki from Japanese treaty ports to American tables, we also illuminate the migrant role in an expanding, transnational network of food importers who met Nikkei demand for soy sauce and other flavors of home as well as a growing American appetite for Japanese cuisine. We find that Nikkei entrepreneurs laid the economic and cultural foundations for the global sushi economy. ","Sukiyaki: Japanese Migration And The Global Circulation Of Japanese Hot Pot"

Unfortunately, I am beginning to feel the same vibrations from the Diocese. Her frustrations were not unique – beginning in the mid-1960s, white Catholics in Brooklyn began to feel neglected by their church as it increased its outreach in non-white and non-Catholic neighborhoods through a Diocesan War on Poverty. Outside of their families, the church was the most important source of identity, socialization, and community for urban Catholics, and its increasing advocacy of liberal policies created tensions with conservative parishioners. This paper will trace the eroding political authority of the Catholic Church in the lives of white Brooklyn Catholics. While urban historians have examined the politics of the working-class during this period in relation to other institutions central to their lives – namely, political parties and labor unions – they have omitted the church. As Catholics began to cast doubt on the ability of these institutions to speak on their behalf, this paper will show, they sought new means of representation in the emerging conservative movement. Through this form of grassroots protest, they remade the Catholic Church into a more politically restrained institution that had the authority to speak on moral but not political matters.

Stone in a letter to fellow right-wing activist Kent Courtney. Stone considered the federal government the greatest threat to individual and economic freedom in the United States, and he often employed conspiratorial anti-communist rhetoric to demonize liberalism and state power. Despite their prevalence, radical conservatives have garnered little attention from historians. This paper addresses this omission by analyzing the political activism and influence of Willis E. Stone and his ultraconservative organization, the Liberty Amendment Committee. From the early 1960s through the mid-1970s, Stone served as the national chairman for the Liberty Amendment Committee, building an organization dedicated to stringent fiscal conservatism. He single-mindedly pursued the ratification of the Liberty Amendment, which called for the retrenchment of federal economic interventionism and the repeal of the sixteenth amendment. The Liberty Amendment received support from right-wing politicians like Congressman James B. Utt (R-CA) and far-right champions like Billy James Hargis and Kent Courtney, and Stone utilized grassroots organizing and mass publications to connect far-right platforms to mainstream politics. More broadly, Stone and the Liberty Amendment Committee contributed to the formation of modern conservatism by providing an outlet for disillusioned right-wingers and acting as a point of convergence for mainstream and far-right conservatives.","Taxation As Tyranny: Willis E.

The fledging denomination took steps in the mid 1920s to organize as a religious body with congregations in the U.S. and Mexico. Since its inception, the Asamblea Apostólica was comprised mostly of Mexican farmworkers, and members sought creative ways to carve out a social existence in California’s factories in the fields. The funding to build their temples adds another layer of social complexity to this narrative of dogged resilience. The financial contributions of workers in a colonial labor system could hardly sustain a movement much less finance a building project, so women set out to finance the building of new temples through the sale of tamales. In fact, most churches in the Central Valley stayed afloat and financed larger projects with funds generated by the sale of tamales made by women in their own or church kitchens. As a place where women ministered to one another, devised new project plans, and even critically examined decisions and sermons, the kitchen was arguably the most important space second only to the sanctuary of worship. When members of the church attained better jobs (cannery work for women and construction or factory work for men), they relied less on the sales of handmade goods and foods as fundraisers. For them, money indeed grew from the ground and came from ground corn. ","Temples Made With Hands: Mexican Pentecostal Women And The Construction Of Farmworker Temples In Central Valley"

The Educating Harlem edited volume argues that Harlem’s educational history is best described as an ongoing contestation across the course of the 20th century, rather than the more familiar arc of the rise and fall of an urban school system. Harlem’s educational activism was multiple and varied, motivated by a wide range of visions of educational processes and outcomes, and carried forth by diverse groups of local actors. Although less tightly organized around a single argument, the Educating Harlem Digital Collection in development supports this argument by featuring a range of voices (via primary sources and oral histories) as well as a range of knowledge producers (high school students through established scholars) in narrating Harlem’s education history digitally.        With these two projects having run on parallel tracks to this point, we are now able to bring them into better connection with one another.

The process and negotiations involved in maximizing digital access to a traditionally-published print volume from a university press and finding synergies between print and online projects.2. The value of an ongoing and collaborative digital history project for creating points of connection with multiple interested communities and perhaps serving as a bridge between these communities and the project’s scholarship in print. 3.

However, she transformed the Alexandre Dumas fils play Camille from a tragedy of a tubercular courtesan into a sentimental morality tale about a silly flirt who learns to reform her ways. Davenport had toured theaters in the Atlantic world since her debut as a child star in the 1830s. Camille was part of her ongoing efforts to sustain her purchase as a star in a competitive entertainment culture.This paper will explore how actresses in the 1850s adapted female-centered French melodramas in their efforts to launch and sustain careers as touring stars. In the U.S., success meant appealing to theater’s expanding white middle-class publics, particularly women. Actresses and the managers and playwrights with whom they collaborated on these plays entered an ongoing cultural struggle over public knowledge and discussion of female erotic desire and sexual vice.In 1856, American actress Matilda Heron introduced a shockingly raw portrayal of Marguerite Gauthier in New York. Ladies fainted, sobbed, then clamored to see it again. One critic described the performance as the outgushings of a woman’s soul stripped of all the conventional traditions of the stage and leaving only the truth of woman’s nature. Heron had developed the character in tours of the West, developing a distinctive acting style that was identified as American. Iit was Heron’s American Camille, with its romantic evocation of frontier culture, that established the viability of immoral French melodramas with American audiences.

This clashed with the U.S.  anti-Communist agenda that they had brought to the negotiating table.  The surge of socialist and populist political movements and a more nationalist and pluralist interpretation of Democracy across the region threatened Truman’s ability to sell its Cold War agenda.  The self-determination agenda dominated initial negotiations but the dynamics quickly changed after Colombia’s populist Democratic Party leader Jorge Eliécer Gaitán was assassinated as the regional negotiations unfolded.  His assassination ignited El Bogotazo, the violent populist manifestation that marked the beginning of the longest Civil War in the Americas. President Truman and Secretary Marshall capitalized on the uprising to use public diplomacy as an instrument to sell their anti-Communist agenda at the conference.  The paper argues that Truman’s anti-Communist propaganda campaign launched by Secretary Marshall from Colombia marked the beginning of the Cold War in the Americas, setting the precedent for Containment policies across the Global South.  The public diplomacy strategy implemented in Colombia showed positive results, revealing its transferability to other regions of the world where self-determination posed a threat to U.S. global policy. The paper concludes by arguing that new institutions, programs, and actors surfaced in the U.S. as the public diplomacy strategy phased cultural and political challenges overseas that impeded the implementation of a one size fits all policy.

Beginning in the late-nineteenth century, African American performing troupes put on tent shows throughout the South, performing under canvas tents in rural areas that did not have theaters which welcomed black audiences. Tent shows soon became associated with country and vaudeville blues acts, such as Ma Rainey and Her Washboard Tub Band. However, another common association with tent shows was female impersonators on the black vaudeville and minstrelsy circuits, who were often called tent show queens. Richard Little Richard Penniman got his start in performance on this circuit and was a tent show queen himself, appearing under the name Princess LaVonne. The liminal form of the tent show – a temporary performance space that mimicked but did not reproduce all of the conventions of a traditional theater – is a generative site through which to understand early black queer performances.  This paper will demonstrate how black performers crafted personae and performances through multiple forms of entertainment on traveling circuits to help open up new possibilities for southern queer life in the Jim Crow era.

The Gary Convention signaled the emergence of a new black political leadership, led by mayors like Richard Hatcher along with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, with a commitment to shaping national policy but also sharp differences in political vision.  By the end of the 1970s, those divisions hampered the ability of that political class to respond to shifts in the Carter Administration's urban and economic policies.  The paper concludes by examining differences among black mayors in how they responded to the Jackson presidential campaign and, by extension, to the broader rightward shift in national politics.","The City Is The Black Man’s Land: Black Mayors, National Politics And Urban Policy, 1967-1988"

Although criminal law was proactively used as an instrument of colonialism and a means to suppress Indigenous rights and cultural practices by U.S. authorities in Alaska during the territorial period, there were moments when the courtroom could become - however briefly - not just a space of colonial oppression but one that allowed for the meeting and integration of Western and Indigenous legal tradition. Mediated though their voices were by the lawyers who represented them, witness statements, motions, and jury instructions included in the records give us access both to the voices of the Indigenous men who were charged with murder in these cases and the Indigenous legal principles that explained their actions and framed their understanding of the issues. Taken together, these cases allow us to examine the courtroom itself as a borderland where the meeting of two separate legal traditions produced outcomes that cannot be fully understood by reference to Western legal tenets alone.","The Courtroom As Site Of Colonial Contact: Encounters Between Western And Indigenous Legal Tradition In Alaska's Territorial Courts"

With clever posters that claim, the corporation has no belly button! protestors’ impulse has been to insist that the corporation is not a person. Many critics agree that corporate personhood is a dangerous social fiction, while some legal scholars dismiss the uproar, saying it’s just a metaphor. This paper insists that corporations are and have been people ever since they became enchanted in the late nineteenth century. The paper traces enchantment by examining the 1890 incorporation of the American Tobacco Company (ATC). Two elements were necessary for enchantment. First, the ATC formed under New Jersey’s new, controversial incorporation laws that put virtually no limit on corporate activities. Second, when facing legal challenge, the ATC successfully used the 14th Amendment to claim federal protection from state regulation, creating crucial precedents for corporate entities claiming constitutional human rights. African American men, in contrast, found that states could limit their use of the 14th Amendment through segregation laws. Corporate and human legal personhood, then, played out on the same legal field. Because the law is a closed system of symbols, this enhanced corporate personhood was not a social fiction but a legal fact with great material consequence. Taking issue with Weber’s notion that Western managerial bureaucracy rationalized economic life, the paper ends by showing how the legal economic life of corporate persons generated a magical effervescence that transferred to entrepreneurs.","The Enchantment Of The Corporate Person"

Inspired by a 1970’s medicine show performance at the International Brotherhood of Magic Conference in Las Vegas, magician Scott McClelland created his act, Professor Crookshank, the Purveyor of Wonderment, who promises to be the perfect panacea for everyday conundrums…just what the doctor ordered! Other contemporary magicians also take up this performance as quack doctors and salesmen: Dr. Wilson (Paul Szauser) peddles a medical elixir, J. Phineas Flusterbeck (Mark Nilsen) offers a Blue Root Elixir, and Dyno Staats blends medicine with science and steampunk in his Las Vegas circuit. McClelland, Szauser, Nilsen, and Staats all draw upon the histories of itinerant medicine and performance to craft their magical patter, reiterating popular conceptions of the nineteenth-century performance, medicine, and practice.   Magic performers have often traded on historical figures or epochs in order to cultivate interesting performances; however, these have not been examined as a form of history in and of itself.  In this paper,  I propose to explore the popular histories that magicians embody and disseminate through their performances.  I specifically explore the relationships between the history of medicine, quackery, and American history these performances reimagine.   Placing the magic performer within a larger culture of historical performance (Old West reenactments and living history museums), I position the magician as both a participant and purveyor of an embodied practice of history.","The Magic Of History:  Reenacting The Travelling Medicine Show"

Steeped in the under-documented material culture of Mexican immigrants and its emotive historical underpinnings, this close re-orientation of the documentation, exhibition, and resonance of the diversity of material culture that has shaped an undervalued emotive history of Mexican immigration in Mexico and the United States will advance the study of the historical relationship between emotions and material culture. It will also demonstrate the energizing potential of researching and teaching the emotive configuration of Mexican immigration as an accessible and expansive historical process to students new to the history of immigration. Humanely inclusive and nuanced in its conceptualization of the emotional inspiration, travels, and impact of a material culture that marks a departure from historical scholarship that has overlooked the enduring and formidable influence of an underestimated world of emotional border crossings and settlement decisions, this presentation of the inner-workings and generative potential of The Material of Memory promises to invigorate our historical approach to Mexican immigration.","The Material Of Emotive History: Reorienting The History Of Mexican Immigration"

Baby Doe’s story is typically told as one of scandalous love and redemptive privation. This paper focuses on Tabor’s later life, a period when she came to be known as an eccentric recluse, dressing in rags and living outside Leadville, Colorado, in a shack next to the stubbornly unproductive Matchless Mine. Describing Baby Doe’s material faith and penitential practices, it considers artifacts collected from Tabor’s shack after her death, as well as an unruly array of scraps, prayers, tea and palm readings, letters, and horoscopes, which Tabor referred to as her Dreams and Visions. While studies of frontier religion in the U.S. have tended to focus on the missionary efforts of Protestants intent to evangelize their nation and the world, this paper takes up this provocative Irish Catholic miner and her material metaphysics in order to trace the changing religious dynamics of an imperial nation in the context of volatile capital enterprises. In the process, it questions how the metaphysics of Baby Doe figure scandal as a historical practice and how the afterlife of Tabor’s transgressive religiosity helps showcase the formal assumptions and mysterious workings of American religious history.","The Metaphysics Of Baby Doe Tabor: Scandal On The Frontiers Of American Religion"

In a few short years he has all but doubled his cinematic output, creating films that have garnered widespread critical attention.  Assessing these films, which include To the Wonder (2013), Knight of Cups (2016), the IMAX documentary Voyage of Time (also 2016), and Song to Song (2017), I hope to show how Malick’s recent work channels the influence of a book that won the National Book Award in 1962, when he was still an impressionable undergraduate at Harvard.  Malick eventually abandoned a budding academic career in philosophy, but his subsequent work in Hollywood remained indebted to Walker Percy’s existential novel The Moviegoer.  For many years Malick was rumored to be working on an adaptation of the book.  Although that project never came to fruition, traces of Percy’s influence can be found in each of Malick’s recent films.  That influence has informed a series of loosely autobiographical works depicting the search for both individual and cosmic meaning.  I argue that these films constitute a kind of philosophizing by other means.  My paper suggests that Percy and Malick are part of a vibrant American tradition that continues to treat philosophical inquiry not so much as an academic pursuit, but rather as a way of life.","The Moviegoer As Philosopher From Walker Percy To Terrence Malick"

During the fad years, Chinese Americans capitalized on an opportunity to market their authenticity while using the same game to build a sense of Chinese American unity. In the interwar era, after the national craze died down, Chinese Americans used the game in unique ways to navigate tensions associated with Americanization, including pressure to foster inclusion, survive exclusion, and nurture intra-cultural cohesion. Mahjong could be a point of commonality across generations because it was both Chinese and American – a Chinese game whose cultural meaning transformed because of American consumption. In the context of internal debates over redeveloping Chinatowns as tourist destinations, mahjong demonstrates complex dualities of ethnic cultural creation: how Chinese Americans participated in commodifying and marketing mahjong as an aspect of Chinese culture, while also using it to create separate ethnic spaces for Chinese Americans to engage with each other.The story of how mahjong became American is also a story of particular communities becoming American in the twentieth century. The history of mahjong is, in part, the uneven history of how the nation came to identify itself as a multiracial democracy, and how different groups experienced the possibilities, limitations, and potential costs of integration.

According to UFW leaders, the 1969 Coachella grape strike reflected local farmworkers’ efforts to claim their American citizenship-based rights. In their labor struggle, the Union said, Coachella farmworkers advanced the nation’s liberal egalitarianism and sought to undermine the remaining vestiges of undemocratic social relations. In turn, when American consumers boycotted Californian grapes they helped their fellow citizens fight for their shared country. This Americanist language, however, was not deployed by pro-UFW Coachella farmworkers. For them, the Union represented a variety of potential projects and futures rooted in the Mexican Revolution and Chicano Movement politics. Critically, these Mexican- and Chicano-centered projects erased the presence of migrant Filipino grape workers, (who represented a third of Coachella’s grape harvest labor force), and reflected the longstanding divisions between the two racialized farmworker communities. Within these erasures and divisions, the union’s future viability remained in question. ","The Nature Of Victories: The United Farm Workers’ 1969 Coachella Strike And Its Promise Of A New America"

After all the regular season games have been played, and the conferences have sorted out their champions, the men from West Point and the Naval Academy meet in early December for their annual tussle.  The game is secondary to the pageantry that surrounds it.  Soldiers attend in mass.  Mayors and governors jockey to attract/keep the game in their jurisdictions.  The President of the United States typically attends too, crossing from one side of the field to the other at halftime in order to show neutrality.  But how did this game become a site of political theater?  And why did the political nature of the contest seem to rise as the football prowess of the service academies declined?  This project explores the politicization of the Army-Navy football game.  While politicians’ desire to be seen as supportive of the US Military is long-standing and not particularly difficult to explain, the dynamics surrounding the rise of this football game deserve further exploration.  The role of race at the academies, and thus as part of the game, receives special attention.  Also, the behind the scenes negotiations to host the game—usually in Philadelphia or Baltimore—are informative.  The failure of politicians in Washington DC, including the President of the United States, to secure the playing of the game in the nation’s capital reveals illuminating fissures within the fabric of America’s federal/state compromise.","The President’s Game: The Politicization Of The Army-Navy Football Game, 1890-1918"

After introducing this perspective, it hones in on the long 1850s from the end of the Mexican-American War to the outbreak of the Civil War as a period when the combination of a hugely expanded public domain, southern strict constructionism, and public aversion to taxation led northern politicians to see land grants as the best means to finance various development projects, such as railroads and land-grant universities.","The Public Domain As A Fiscal Resource In The 1850S"

Wood, the mayor of Natchez from 1870 to 1872 and the only black mayor in Reconstruction Mississippi. While scholars have increasingly drawn attention to freedpeople’s politics in the wake of emancipation, the realm of municipal politics remains largely unexplored. Wood’s electoral victory was more than a symbol of the rise of black political power; rather, it ushered in a major policy shift in the city of Natchez. Responding to the votes of former slaves, Wood’s administration instituted major criminal justice reforms. These reforms, however, strained the biracial coalition that Wood had constructed in the racially divided city, and they show the difficulty that black officeholders faced in implementing policies that ensured freedom for the formerly enslaved. And while the national backlash against Reconstruction did no favors for Wood and his allies, it was their progressive policies and leadership that prompted local white supremacists to drive them out of office.","The Radical Mayor: Biracial Coalitions And The Politics Of Justice In Reconstruction Natchez"

This version of history is only partially true.  The attitudes toward and the rules governing the involvement of women in ministry were adopted from the holiness movement that pre-dated  Pentecostals.  While early Pentecostals generally accepted women in ministry, they did so only to a degree, classifying them as evangelists or missionaries, restricting their ability to perform church rites such as baptism, and allowing them to pastor only on a temporary basis. Women seeking roles as church leaders then might look to serve only in arenas where they could lead ministries and not compete with men.              The development of the early Pentecostal organizations and thus their particular rules concerning women in ministry came at a time when the role of women was changing in the United States.  Women nation-wide had been part of reform movements such as the temperance or suffrage movements, the later of which was more controversial within the church. Thus, the women had to be careful to portray both their work and their persons in ways that did not offend more conserative male ministers.

But officials of the newly created federal government quickly discovered that the lands the United States claimed to own teemed with preexisting claimants, including Native nations, residents who settled under earlier European empires, and even Revolutionary veterans demanding land bounties promised them. Before the federal government could begin selling public lands, then, it first had to adjudicate, through an ad hoc administrative procedure, these claimants’ respective title to the land. This process helped bolster federal authority in the borderlands and translate plural property claims into a single definitive governmental document conferring ownership.","The Rise Of Federal Title"

The segregation of professional sports faced pressure from African American journalists of California newspapers who voiced their support for desegregating professional sports teams during the 1930s and 1940s. In Southern California, Edward Abie Robinson (Los Angeles Sentinel, San Francisco Sun-Reporter), William Claire Halley Harding (Los Angeles Tribune), and Herman Hill (West Coast Bureau chief, Pittsburgh Courier) each played an important role advocating or promoting integration.

Prior to the founding of the School, even Ph.D. students in the Humanities did not receive systematic instruction in critical theory.  Attending the School rapidly became one of the most sought after career opportunities in American academia, both because of its curriculum, as well as its prestigious faculty and board members, such as Hayden White and Edward Said. As numerous testimonial letters found in the School’s archive attest, after spending one summer at the School, the attendees- mostly junior professors- would radically change the curricula in the their undergraduate and graduate classes, thereby moving critical theory and Postmodernism from the cutting edge to a position of orthodoxy.   Thus, this paper shows how the theoretical underpinnings of Postmodernism rose to a position of dominance in the classrooms of American universities in the last quarter of the twentieth century.

Each of these hopes, however, was dashed. Commencing with the first Red Scare, a resurgent conservative backlash took hold. At the forefront of that movement stood the Sentinels of the Republic, formed in 1922 to fight the third crisis in American history of federal paternalism. This paper recovers the history of the largely overlooked Sentinels who took aim at each of the maternalist projects, defeating the federal child labor amendment and derailing other initiatives they perceived would encroach upon the sovereignty of the white home.The paper argues the Sentinels found an effective way to galvanize opposition to the State across faith and class lines by defending the right of men to govern their families. It will explore how the male-dominated leadership of the Sentinels, comprised largely of Boston Brahmins, forged alliances with the Catholic Church, farmers, Southern industrialists and anti-suffragists. Building on scholarship recovering the activism of conservative women in the 1920s, the paper broadens that inquiry by considering how a gendered anti-statist ideology drew a diverse array of men and women into politics. Finally, by tracing the ties of the Sentinels to post-New Deal conservative lobbies, the paper proposes new ways to think about the importance of gender to the emergence of modern conservative politics.","The Sentinels Of The Republic: The Politics Of The Family In Anti-Statist Activism 1922-1933"

The difference in the forms of economy was not trivial. Immigrants experienced not merely the feeling of homelessness but the shock of industrial technology, scientific discourses that had shaped the rise of American power, and a rapid pace of life associated with mechanization in US society.My paper will use state hospital records to analyze the medicalization of the shocks of transition to US society by the doctors who treated immigrant Mexicans to California between 1935-1965, paying careful attention to the scientific language that was used to justify the placement of immigrants in medical asylums operated by the state government. Reciprocally, the paper will analyze the works of art and journal accounts that immigrants produced to illuminate the subjective understandings they had of their own movement into US society, hoping thereby to provide an alternative formulation of migrant subjectivity that humanizes the intense struggle that immigrants felt as they sought to make sense of a radically different society.The competing narratives of change produced by the doctors and immigrants will be used to inquire about the morality of state policies that denied a political voice to human beings trapped in the cycles of economic change and political disfranchisement, and to understand how historical narratives can be used today to provide legal recognition to immigrants trapped in the modern US/Mexico economic relationship.","The Shock Of Transition: Discourses Of Change In The Industrial State"

Indeed in the current age of social media, historians increasingly find themselves in the uncomfortable position of publicly self-promoting their work. Professional advancement often necessitates asserting themselves in the ether as the once protective walls of academic space crumble around them. Yet how to be a public intellectual and not, as Richard Hofstadter famously warned …lose his respect for the integrity, the independence, the pastness of the past? How to lend wisdom to debates of the present and bring some needed perspective, without discomforting the past. Hofstadter, and five of his fellow travellers faced this same dilemma in July of 1970  when Newsweek magazine asked them (Arthur Schlesinger, Staughton Lynd, Andrew Hacker, Daniel Boorstin, and Eugene Genovese) for 2000 word essays on the crisis of the American Spirit. Their responses occupied some 16 pages of the July 6 edition of the magazine, serving as a journalistic response to an emerging we are coming apart narrative that sought to describe how, if not why, American’s social, cultural and political fabric was unraveling. The extensive and thoughtful words of these six also helped Newsweek address three distinct challenges to the field of journalism. The substance of their responses also revealed the not so subtle battle lines that had been drawn in the field of history over the question of relevance; a dispute so hard fought  that it had created a highly contentious walk out by a new wave of social historians at the 1968 AHA Convention. Lynd and Genovese were at the center of this dispute and on opposite sides.In respecting the field’s figurative Maginot Line that stood, often ineffectively, against  the pitfalls of presentism, historians then, as now, were also tempted by the need for relevance. Despite the rifts in the field, the Six straddled this line remarkably, and in the context of their essays also helped Newsweek address its substantial, though not wholly dissimilar media challenges.   Their responses exuded a credibility the media competed to regain as the Nixon-Agnew attacks against media bias continued unabated. Their essays also conformed to the more in depth expressions of a new journalism that was competing with conventional journalistic methodology. Finally, as Graham’s Newsweek continued to try and catch Luce’s Time in the circulation competition, the essays stood as a stark contrast to Time’s concurrent celebration of the American flag written by Lance Morrow.Perhaps most noteworthy for historians of 2018, the six resisted the temptation to invoke historical examples or concoct historical lessons to inform the present crisis. Rather, their sweeping essays exuded their historical perspective that in itself provided an authoritative and credible perspective on the present while remaining true to the contours of a different past. They refused the temptation to present the past in ways that might wave a magic wand and alleviate public concerns about the present. ","The Six And The Sixties"

A year before division festered in the ranks of the State Progressive Spiritualist Association, Josie K. Folsom had become the first woman in the St. Louis history to officiate a wedding. The crest of her local fame, however, was the notoriety she received after a protégé accused her of defrauding the public through bogus mediation of the spirits. Folsom had been ordained in 1897 and had pastored the Olive Street Spiritualist Congregation Church before becoming treasurer of the state association. The charges of fraud centered on accusations that she had forged spiritual writings on cards produced during her séances and had contrived spirit pictures by transferring halftones from Post-Dispatch advertisements. Folsom rebuffed the accusations, claiming that she stands for religion, not for fraud, but her defense and numerous appeals were unsuccessful.  Little more than a year after the scandal broke, however, Folsom had found a new calling—and new credentials—in the Society of Scientific and Religious Truthseekers, where she offered weekly lectures and psychic demonstrations.

More so than the left, the right tends to be concerned about the excesses of democracy and a turn toward mob rule. To conservatives, the U.S. Constitution is admired and revered largely because it places checks on the public’s passions, ensuring order and stability. According to conservative intellectuals, excessive flattery of the common people, and vilification of the elite, can lead a nation down a path that ends with the guillotine and devastation; the unchecked masses are more than a threat to the power of existing elites; unrestrained and led by a demagogue, they can threaten the basic stability that a society needs to flourish. On the other hand, American conservatism also seeks to be a mass movement, and the nature of representative democracy precludes too much open elitism. To secure elections, the Republican Party has to praise its base. For the most part, the conservative movement seems to understand this, and some prominent conservative journalists and intellectuals have embraced populist rhetoric. Conservatism has, often successfully, branded itself as a common sense ideology with plain-old-folks appeal. In this paper, I will consider the historical relationship between populism and conservatism, primarily focusing on elite conservative media. I argue that the conservative movement never successfully resolved this tension, and William F. Buckley’s failure to complete The Revolt Against the Masses (which he expected to be his magnum opus), can be viewed as a metaphor for this entire relationship.","The Stillborn Revolt Against The Masses: Conservative Intellectuals And The Question Of Populism"

For the next 27 months, they conducted the most extensive national political debate in American history over the radio. The world events of September 1939 to December 1941 coincided with the flowering of the national radio networks in the United States. The overwhelming majority of Americans had access to a radio, and the still relatively new networks had managed to cover virtually the entire country. Momentous events coincided with a previously unattainable ability for the average American to listen directly to a wide variety of voices proposing an impressive range of opinions.By the late 1930s, the radio was no longer the luxury item it had been as recently as 1930. By 1940, 90% of the people in urban areas outside the South had radios (in Southern urban areas, the rate was 79%).  Among urban whites, radio ownership was nearly universal: 94.4%.  Rural areas, not surprisingly, had somewhat lower ownership rates, but overall, the vast majority of Americans by 1940 had radios and lived in places covered by the three national networks (NBC, CBS, and Mutual). Both sides in the debate therefore came increasingly to see radio as a key medium for persuading public opinion. That competition spurred the development of ever-more sophisticated ways for political groups to use the medium of radio for political purposes. What began with standard political speeches by prominent speakers like FDR and former president Herbert Hoover came to include an impressive cross-section of elite opinion: not just the president and former president, not just members of Congress, but university presidents and professors, business and labor leaders, military officers and diplomats, journalists and commentators. Even more significantly, the need to shape public opinion led both sides to pursue ever-more sophisticated media strategies. They engaged each other in on-air policy debates. They produced special programs, sometimes with high production values. They incorporated fund-raising pleas into their programs. They put on extravaganzas featuring Hollywood and radio celebrities. Both America First and the Committee to Defend America recorded speeches (known then as transcriptions) and distributed them widely to local radio stations not affiliated with the national networks in order to extend their reach. In short, they revolutionized how political groups used the radio.In line with the theme of the 2018 conference, this presentation will make extensive use of audio clips from relevant radio programs and images culled from multiple archives to support the argument.","The Air War: How The Great Debate Over World War Ii Revolutionized Politics On The Radio"

On the one hand investment dollars from across the globe were ready to flood San Diego in a quest to develop an international city. Yet, there was considerable pushback from citizens who did not want to see Americas Finest City become another Los Angeles. As was the case in many anti-growth revolts of the period, the central fear involved visons of a smog-filled, traffic-laden, urban hellscape. For San Diego, the fear was heightened by proximity to the border. In the minds of many citizens, the more the city grew the more the sieve-like conditions of the border would negatively impact quality of life in San Diego (mainly via drugs and crime). Then mayor at the time Pete Wilson, cut his political teeth as a young city councilmen by stoking fears of the border and immigration. Therefore, he was uniquely qualified to thread the needle of conservative politics in the period by on the one hand pushing for more cross-border capitalist development while also providing psychological comfort for his constituents by cracking down on crime. This formula became a keystone of neoliberal politics for advancing a new economy that was dependent on globalized development and labor markets while also providing meat to middle-class voters concerned about their place in the new global order.

This paper critically examines the alliance between Nairobi and Venceremos, beginning with its inception at the College of San Mateo’s Third World Liberation Front strike in 1968 through the Colleges’ demise in the 1970s. In contrast to the more renowned San Francisco State and University of California, Berkeley Third World struggles, Nairobi and Venceremos viewed self-determination as only achievable apart from the apparatus of a state-operated university. The Colleges also viewed their struggle for self-determination as emanating from and interconnected with racially- and economically-oppressed communities in the Peninsula, adopting the slogan, The community is the campus.Not only did the Colleges operate primarily out of existing community institutions, including libraries, churches, and even residents’ homes; they also directed their resources and student body toward work to improve the conditions of their communities, from free health care clinics and food distribution to re-entry programs and drug rehabilitation, even extending to local labor solidarity. Yet tensions mounted as the Colleges’ priorities diverged. Nairobi eventually focused solely on creating avenues for upward socioeconomic mobility for East Palo Altans while Venceremos pursued fomenting imminent armed revolution to the United States. The histories of Nairobi and Venceremos Colleges thus offer an illustration of the tenuousness of alliances stretched between social contexts and through evolutions in ideology and praxis.","To Serve Community And Campus: Nairobi And Venceremos Colleges And Third World Alliances For Self-Determination In The San Francisco Peninsula"

The fur trade is equally problematic, my students see white men dressed in buckskin and living in the wilderness. When questionaed about Indian dress students describe clothing made from animal skins. These prevailing stereotypes can be interdicted by introducing hands-on learning into and especially, outside the classroom. Direct experience at nearby museums allows student to see  different pieces of Indian clothing where they can hold and examine the eighteenth-century items worn by Indians. Images of empty landscapes filled with Indians in breechcloths and women in fringed buckskin dresses changes and revises their opinions about the nature of the fur trade world in the western Great Lakes. I have also begun to collect the trade silver that decorated Indian clothing. In an amazing process of self-discovery, motivated by looking at and handling objects, students soon understand that there were many Indians living in the Great Lakes frontier, that this was not a vacant wilderness, that Indians dressed elegantly in European trade cloth because of the fur trade, and that Indian prosperity was evident from the hundreds of silver ornaments that they wore at one time. This talk focuses on fur trade silver that I have collected and how I have incorporated it into my research and used it in the classroom to complement museum field trips.

I take as a case study a wounded Confederate soldier who wrote his fiancée a series of letters that detailed his favorable response to a popular British domestic novel that he had read in camp while awaiting a medical review board’s decision on whether he was fit for active duty. With this soldier were 900 men who faced a similar fate. The soldier was not hopeful. Rarely is one found sufficiently afflicted with the ‘wills that flesh is heir to’ to entitle him to a clear discharge, he explained. This has now become the great limbo of deformed and crippled humanity. As the references to Hamlet and to an essay by Joseph Addison suggest, the soldier understood that desperate men take desperate action. That had been most graphically evidenced by three recent suicide attempts in camp. All three men had slit their throats; one had succeeded in killing himself. The others would recover. Oh! the untold misery that follows war, he added. It destroys body, mind and soul. As he penned the letter, a fourth man successfully committed suicide. The juxtaposition of these conversations – one about war’s destruction, the other about the sentiment aroused by this soldier’s reading of a domestic novel – illuminates one of reading’s myriad functions during wartime, namely its purported ability to connect soldiers with their people back home.","Transcending The Mountain Of Human Misery: Epistolary Conversations About Books During Wartime"

Often, these olfactory techniques including using African understandings of the transgressive power of different animal forms. Alongside scholars such as James Sweet, Stephanie Camp, and Jason Young this piece shows how African survivals, especially concerning olfactory medicine and animal spiritualism, offered Africans in the New World spaces to assert their own forms of identity. These olfactory and symbolic responses were hard to identify and troublesome to white planters who could not perceive the olfactory complexity of African cultures because they asserted African odors as a simple biological inferiority. Thus, African slaves’ uses of odor and animals through Obeah, Candomble, Santeria, and voodoo rituals became hidden transcripts to which the elites of colonial culture were partially anosmiac, due to their stereotypical racist olfactory binaries. African medical practitioners did not desire such anosmia in their religious devotion and medical practices. African retention of the idea of smelling-out witches, poison, and disease and using animals as ephemeral portals within rituals survived the Middle Passage in nearly all American slave societies. African slaves used these ideas about animals and odors as a way to mark their own territory against their masters. This setting of rival geographies through smell, ritual, and animals constitutes a structural marker of revolutionary agency.

As both consumers of mass culture, and members of America’s body politic, students have been inundated with ideological rhetoric. Once more, such rhetoric is often saturated in historical jargon. For instructors this not only makes navigating the traditional curriculum more difficult, it obstructs our ability to present matters related to peacemaking, social justice, and political dissent to our students as valid components of American history.As an instructor at a state college tasked primarily with teaching US survey courses, I have worked to develop teaching methods and practices that help me to better transverse partisan divides within my classroom. As a specialist in US movements for peace and social justice moreover, I have been able to use these same pedagogical practices to instill upon my students the valuable roll that activism and peacemaking have played in our shared history as Americans. In this paper I intend to explain these methods, as well as the resources and assessment tools associated with them. These include a focus on the debate about the limits of civil liberty and national security, an emphasis on history from the bottom-up, and the incorporation of various primary sources that help to both promote critical thinking, and apprise students about the abilities of everyday individuals like themselves.","Traversing Partisanship And Teaching Peace And Justice In The Us History Survey"

Many scholars have pointed out that by the late 1950s televisions had created a new enchanted sensibility among Americans, and they have argued (as Manuel Castells has) that this new culture of real virtuality transformed make-believe into belief in the making.  In this paper I investigate how televisions made imagined worlds of make-believe—including, for instance, heavenly afterlife worlds—into realities that seemed believable.  I do this by examining two different developments in the 1950s and 1960s:  1) how television producers of scifi anthology programs such as One Step Beyond and The Twilight Zone depicted televisual spaces themselves as real otherworldly spaces; and 2) how Christian televangelists used televisions to show that invisible electrical/spiritual forces could be transmitted between believers and from heavenly levels to earthly ones.  In these cases and in others, new American televisions were much more than objects that, once purchased, provided entertainment or escape; they also created an enchanted, spiritual imagination that made otherworldly spaces and disembodied presences seem closer, more real and more believable.","Tuning The Invisible:  Televisual Transmissions Of Other Worlds And Disembodied Spirits"

Specifically, the Unemployed Councils of the Communist Party, USA serve as an oft-cited example of urban restlessness and the collective power of unemployed workers. Yet in Chicago in 1931, jobless workers created an economically mainstream version of the CPUSA Unemployed Councils, called the Workers Committee on Unemployment (WCOU). Through the WCOU – 20,000 strong at its height – unemployed workers publicized the plight of the unemployed, demanded an end to the demoralizing casework system, and called on the Illinois state government to increase relief funds for the city. Rather than calling for an overhaul of American capitalism, members of the WCOU did all of this in partnership with moderate reformers in the city: settlement house workers, pastors, and leaders in the Urban League.This paper examines the relationship between the WCOU and city reformers, and highlights moments when they intersected with members of the city’s Communist Party Unemployed Councils. WCOU records, public hearing transcripts, and meeting minutes from their reformer allies reveal how these unemployed workers negotiated the rocky terrain of Depression-era work and survival. Together, unemployed workers and urban reformers simultaneously exploited fears of radicalism and distanced themselves from communism, all to lay claim to federal relief and decent work.","Unemployed Workers, Urban Reformers, And The Fate Of Capitalism In 1930S Chicago"

From 1918 to roughly 1942 the Bay Area outing program recruited thousands of Native women from U.S. boarding schools to work as maids in affluent homes across the region. In exchange for room and board and meager wages, Native women cooked, cleaned and lived in the private homes of their employers. Through this program, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) pursued its goal of assimilation: to supplant Native values and traditions with western substitutes. This plan of assimilation through domesticity was a tool of the settler colonial project.This paper argues that Native women domestic workers negotiated and challenged federal assimilation strategies. The lens I employ focuses on the surveillance and monitoring of Native women and the choices and decisions they were obliged to consider. This paper exposes the settler colonial mechanics of the outing program while interrogating the following: within the confines of domestic labor how did Native women comply, resist and negotiate their circumstances? How did Native women rework into these systems, potential and possibility? How did they resist or unsettle the production of federal Indian policy? To this end I examine secondary sources, federal Indian policy, BIA records, never-before analyzed historic newspaper articles and oral history interviews that expose the gendering processes at work in government boarding school curriculum. I first historicize the program and then analyze archival records through two scales; at the macro level through BIA’s Relocation, Training and Employment Assistance archival records that examine the program’s larger structural framework, and at the micro level with 20th-century articles from the Berkeley Daily Gazette, the San Francisco Call and the Oakland Tribune that reveal the on the ground, local consequences of the program. These latter texts reveal a specific, localized rhetoric that sought to justify the control of Native women. Woven through this analysis are interviews that speak to the training of Native women’s bodies through government boarding school instruction. In total, I illuminate the subtle and overt ways Native women resisted and unsettled the policies meant to control them.","Unsettling Domesticity: Native Women Derailing U.s.

The urban reinvestment movement, a nation-wide multiracial coalition of low- and moderate-income urbanites, scored important victories that increased the flow of fair bank loans to capital-starved neighborhoods during the close of the twentieth century. Most importantly, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977 created new banking regulations that pushed banks to finance resident-initiated, small-scale redevelopment—building homes on vacant lots, renovating old buildings, and rehabbing rental housing.This paper explores how urbanites deployed the CRA to increase affordable housing opportunities during the late 1970s and 1980s. The CRA codified a bank’s affirmative obligation to lend in low-income communities outside their offices, and federal bank regulators depended on activists to enforce the law by blowing the whistle on noncompliant banks. However, regulators’ dependence on community groups produced mixed results. On the one hand, this strategy allowed local reinvestment activists to win tailored lending programs with specific neighborhood credit needs in mind. On the other hand, local community-bank partnerships produced only a small supply of affordable housing compared to the overall need. At a time when Reagan-era spending cuts eliminated other resources for low- and moderate-income urbanites, community-bank agreements through the CRA thus became an important but imperfect tool for city residents who sought to improve their neighborhoods.

I argue that policies and practices we call Jim Crow also arose in the North American Southwest beginning in the eighteenth century and developed within successively Spanish, Mexican, and American intercultural communities. Without recourse to chattel slavery as a touchstone for social, political, and economic relations, people in the Southwest developed institutions that defined and differentiated racial hierarchies; that sponsored unfree labor and imprisonment for profit; and that relied on legal and extralegal violence to impose social and spatial segregation. Settlers on New Spain’s northern frontier chose these techniques to distinguish themselves from and to subjugate indigenous populations; Spanish-Mexicans and immigrant European Americans reworked and amplified these policies during the Mexican (1822-1846) and American (1848-) periods. Together, they controlled labor with anti-vagrancy laws and chain-gangs, restricted Indians, Mexicans, and Chinese to rancherias, barrios, and Chinatowns, and lynched Indians, Mexicans, Chinese, and Blacks. Rupturing Jim Crow’s geography and chronology resurfaces North American landscapes of society, politics, and labor past and present and suggests new research questions: On what knowledge did Southern Whites rely when developing what we now call Jim Crow? Did the Southwest provide a model, and did a direct transfer of knowledge take place? Addressing Jim Crow’s long shadow requires a reckoning of its compound, multiregional origins and its multiracial history. ","West Of Jim Crow: A Conceptual And Empirical Framework"

Yet what happens when midwives are not legally recognized?    This paper analyzes the 1974 arrest of lay midwife Kate Bowland, charged with practicing medicine without a license, and the resulting case decided by the state supreme court, Bowland v. Municipal Court (1976). Citing Roe v. Wade, feminist defense attorney Ann Flower Cumings argued that childbirth was not a disease and therefore did not require licensed medical supervision or state regulation.  But the court disagreed.  Roe had never been interpreted so broadly as to protect a woman’s choice of the manner and circumstances in which her baby is born – indeed, the state’s interest in the life of the unborn child supersedes the woman’s own privacy right.  In the context of birth, Roe became a vehicle to constrain reproductive rights, rather than expand them.  Drawing on the personal papers of Kate Bowland, legal proceedings, organizational records, correspondence, and media coverage, I present the Bowland case as a critical moment in the history of childbirth and reproductive rights.","When Legal Mechanisms Fail: Midwifery, Medicine, And The Law In 20Th C.

From the gendered images of fat Texans consuming big gulps of soda in Super Size Me, which targeted the food industry and those who succumbed to the lure of fast food, to threats that insurers would drop overweight enrollees because they were causing their own bad health, obesity had taken on ominous, gendered connotations that surpassed matters of individual health and nutrition. The First Lady brought heart and resources to her promotion of healthy choices and changes in school lunch programs. Fifty years ago, political attention to obesity focused foremost on malnutrition among the nation’s poorest, particularly women suffering from food deprivation that was caused not by wrong-headed diets but their inability to access nutritious food. This paper analyzes the politics of hunger that erupted following its rediscovery during a 1967 tour of prominent senators, including Robert F. Kennedy, in Mississippi. Before obesity was politically uncoupled from poverty, documentary photographers and broadcasters publicized images of both emaciated children and obese mothers. While physicians testified about the bloated bodies of women subsisting on starchy foods, productions such as CBS’s 1968 Hunger in America interviewed pregnant women unable to heed their doctors’ admonitions to stop gaining weight and eat fresh foods. This history and its potential significance today is the subject of this paper.","When Obesity Was A Matter Of Poverty, Not Individual Responsibility  "

Using Louisiana law as a case study, I argue that the law demonstrates the fantasies that lawmakers—white, slaveholding men—projected onto their society. In other words, legal doctrine was a tool that lawmakers used to define and shape the society, making it more a metric of their hopes (and fears) than a lens on the reality on the ground.Even if doctrine like Louisiana’s Black Code/Code Noir (1807) indexed the social fantasies of lawmakers, this talk will show that it remains a useful tool for unearthing the lives of enslaved and free people of color. I locate an opportunity for telling black stories in the fissures between the doctrine and case law (that is, the practice of the law). It was in the courtroom that enslaved and free people of color brought the law to task, pushing on and occasionally cracking open the sliver of opportunity it provided; this talk will use the example of Barclay v. Sewell (1857) to show the crafty way that one woman of color reinvented the legal category of wife to retain her freedom in just this way. Thus where the archives of legal doctrine and case law interact, it is possible to see how white law could be remade by black actors, thus shining a light on black stories in spite of the whiteness of the source.

In the context of the \"second slavery,\" these regions became the world's largest suppliers of coffee and cotton, consolidating themselves as areas of economic expansion, closely connected with the European capitalist market and slave labor. In both places, this process was accompanied not only by the increase of the slave trade, but also by the strengthening of a wealthy class benefited from the profits generated by slavery and the sale of primary genres on a large scale.  The big house had a significant importance in these plantation areas. It was a place where members of the wealthy class worked to keep their heritage, honor and family wealth. However, it was also an area where a variety of domestic slaves - cooks, valets, maids, housekeepers, nannies, wet nurses - fought to build spaces of survival, even if fragile, within the slave institution. Therefore, big houses combined public and private spheres; they put together feelings of intimacy and affection with hard labor relations, power and hierarchy.  As sources, this analysis uses inventories, wills and lists of captives (such as the 1872 Official Brazilian Slaves list and the US censuses) related to big masters and crosses them with other documents such as personal letters, diaries, notebooks narratives and photographs in order to understand how violent and unbalanced were the relations between masters and domestic slaves inside the household.

Dorsey’s archive was a meeting place for many, including W. E. B. Du Bois, who studied materials in Dorsey’s archive to create his landmark study The Philadelphia Negro. Dorsey pieced together shards of history into a massive archive that commemorated Black historical actors and preserved these records for future use. In doing so, he created history that could be remembered, studied, and shared. The archive that Dorsey amassed over seven decades contained overwhelming evidence of Black people’s contributions to politics, science, and creative pursuits that many white Americans denied as Jim Crow policies multiplied after the Civil War.","William Henry Dorsey And The Archiving Of Black Genius"

The paper will utilize the FBI’s own records, most notably those of its Counterintelligence Programs (COINTELPRO) obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests, to illustrate the sustained effort and creative tactics the Bureau deployed against the white activists.  I will incorporate into the presentation a sampling of the records created and collected by the Bureau, displaying them so that session participants can gain a direct sense of the Bureau’s approach, language, and tone.  The documents reflect the Bureau’s heightened sensitivity to dissent and its conflation of political disagreement with disloyalty and subversion.  Moreover, the paper will show that although the white southern students involved in SSOC were but a small group of loosely connected student activists, the FBI’s counterintelligence activities demonstrate that it saw these southern whites as just as much a threat to domestic tranquility as Black Power advocates or white radicals in the North.","With Imagination And Enthusiasm: The Fbi, Cointelpro, And Investigations Of White Student Activists In The 1960S South"

Honduras suffered under the control of the United Fruit Company, whose business model depended on the complete submission of workers to the whims of corporate owners.  During the 1960s, however, a glimmer of hope emerged when a new corporate executive, Eli Black, led a successful takeover of United Fruit.  Black, an ordained rabbi and Polish immigrant, increased Honduran wages, provided free electricity to workers, and made it possible for employees to become homeowners.  Seen as a precursor to the socially conscious capitalist of today, Black tried to reverse years of exploitation and change the image of the United States abroad. The experiment did not last as economic volatility, political turmoil, and environmental catastrophe doomed his reform efforts in the 1970s.  What started as a noble dream ended in tragedy when Black took his own life.  This overlooked chapter of a multinational corporation and the country it exploited reveals lessons about the limits of ethical business practices in an emerging era of free trade.

The institution of slavery resulted in Black women working side by side with Black men during slavery.  Blacks, regardless of gender were barred from educational opportunities throughout the slave South and segregated in Jim Crow schools until the Brown v. Board Supreme Court decision of 1954. The belief in the notion of race uplift – that all Blacks were obligated to help one another –  was one that imbued in the race. Blacks valued and encouraged education for both boys and girls, and established coeducational schools.   Because of the shared experiences of all Blacks, most of the scholarship on their lives has focused until the past decade, primarily on race.  However, as the feminist concept and theory of intersectionality has emerged in foundational work by Patricia Hill Collins and Kimberly Crenshaw, scholars are now exploring how issues of gender, social class and sexuality have also impacted Black experiences.   This presentation explores how intraracial sexism impacted Black women and girls from the late nineteenth century through the Civil Rights era of the 1960s.  Sexism within the Black community was coined Jane Crow by Pauli Murray, activist feminist lawyer and Episcopal priest to describe her experience as a female student in the overwhelmingly male Howard University Law School in Washington, DC. during the 1940s.  Murray had eagerly gone to the Black Howard Law School because it was the training ground for renown black civil rights attorneys.  However, Murray experienced unexpected sexism while attending the Law School  - not being able to attend male smokers and barred from joining the  all-male Law professional organization.   However, these gender slights were not unique to Murray, as early as the late nineteenth century, Black women began to comment on gender distinctions within the race.  The passage of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 which granted Black men the right to vote was the first legal distinction made between Black men and women.  As a result, by 1900 twenty-two black men had served in the Nation’s Congress and scores of others had been elected to state and local government positions.  The privilege of voting resulted in many Black men totally embracing patriarchal notions of manhood. In 1892, Black feminist educator Anna Julia Cooper, raised the issue of sexism within the Black community her book A Voice from the South, noting that black men had fully internalized the role of Victorian men.  The way Black women addressed these issues will be analyzed.","Writing About 'Jane Crow' Instead Of 'Jim Crow"

Unable to secure employment as a social worker in the U.S., Singer traveled to Germany to work for the International Refugee Organization after World War II. After two years she moved to London to study with Anna Freud at her Hampstead clinic. Singer settled nearby, became part of a vibrant world of female psychoanalysts, set up a private practice, and stayed in the UK for the rest of her life.  Her own work as a therapist, teacher, and public intellectual, focused on the study of childhood trauma, no doubt influenced by Anna Freud’s work with child survivors of the Blitz.Writing a biography of Singer will require taking stock of her career (she was the first black psychoanalyst in the UK), as well as sifting through a rich set of contradictory tales she created out of her own history.  This paper explores Singer’s life as an expatriate and the stories that she told about her past.  Fond of fibbing about her family’s roots in slavery, Singer created a past for friends and colleagues in England that she thought they would recognize: an Up From Slavery tale that showed just how far she had come. Singer’s traumatic childhood in the Jim Crow South rarely figured in her storytelling.  I will investigate the stories Singer told about herself and consider how these will shape efforts to write a biography.","Writing Herself Into African American History: The Tales Of Psychoanalyst Marie Battle Singer"

In 1966 the presidents of the United States and Mexico created a joint commission to develop plans for bilateral development along the U.S. –Mexico border. Dubbed the Commission for Border Development and Friendship (CODAF) by American and Mexican diplomats, this organization immediately incited the AFL-CIO’s opposition. CODAF attracted bipartisan support across the borderlands, but it was no match for an unlikely coalition of Republican congressmen and labor leaders, who joined ranks and terminated CODAF’s funding in 1972. This episode in borderlands history provides an interesting case study for the importance of the U.S.-Mexico border and its impact on national political coalitions. As such it sheds light on a crucial moment in American political and labor history by narrating how labor unions turned away from the Democratic Party and sought support from Republican legislators in their attempt to prevent what they called the exportation of American jobs.

Founded in New York City in 1985, God’s Love was premised upon the uncontroversial notion that food was love, a tangible offering of nourishment and care.Today it is an enormously successful nonprofit with a multimillion dollar budget, delivering meals to people incapacitated by a range of illnesses. But the program gained its initial momentum by offering New Yorkers an outlet for expressing empathy regardless of their spiritual or political views --or lack thereof. In its mission and messaging, God’s Love was distinct from the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) and other contemporary organizations: it avoided referencing social justice, righteous anger, finding solutions, and appealing to the government. Instead, its aim was to help ordinary people be of service and thus to find joy and meaning. Such a strategic, individualistic approach enabled God’s Love to amass a broad and varied set of supporters who acted as board members, donors, staff, and volunteers.This paper explores the politics of volunteerism in a context of state retrenchment. By proffering the image of the suffering hungry person who needed help in the simplest, most direct way possible, the ideology of service positioned individual acts of kindness channeled through a private nonprofit as an antidote to the state’s neglect of people with AIDS.","‘An Opportunity To Get In On That Joy’: Food And Service At God’s Love We Deliver"

According to a prevailing mythology about race in our country, that puts the city far beyond the geographic center of racial violence, residential segregation, labor market segmentation, and other past and present manifestations of racism against African Americans.  The grip of this mythology was on full display in Duluth during the summer of 1920, when local whites expressed anguish and surprise after the lynching of three black circus workers there.  Even chief of police John Murphy, who was criticized for not adequately protecting the men while they were in jail, claimed at the time that he and a fellow detective didn’t think anything would happen in this part of the country, that if it were down South it might.  Tellingly, Murphy made the claim during public court testimony in which he liberally littered his account of events with the word nigger, as did many other whites called to the stand.  But that was the least of it.  By engaging the panel session audience in an interactive guided encounter with several different sources—muck-racking newspaper articles, minstrel show advertisements, lynching photographs, and oral history transcripts—this paper will suggest just how deeply rooted and pervasive racism was in Duluth before and after the lynchings.  In this way, it will also offer a compelling case against northern racial exceptionalism.

Sherman’s query about what to do with Confederate leaders, in the event of a Union victory, Abraham Lincoln suggested it would be best if they were allowed to flee the United States. Many Confederates did escape and journeyed to Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Rome, Egypt, British Honduras, and Argentina. However, despite this wide array of countries, historians tend to privilege the experiences of Confederate exiles in Brazil and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom and Canada. Given the proximity of Mexico to many southern states, particularly the Gulf South states, the relative lack of attention to the rebels who slipped across the Rio Grande to make a new life in Mexico is puzzling. Todd Wahlstrom’s recent The Southern Exodus to Mexico does an excellent job discussing exiles, particularly planters who attempted to resettle their slaves in Mexico. This paper, builds on his analysis and highlights men like Judge John Perkins, Henry Watkins Allen, and Nathaniel Beverley Tucker, among others. They did not bring slaves with them, as other Confederates did to Mexico and to Brazil, but sought to create new lives in a new country through other forms of work such as editing newspapers or fomenting U.S. immigration to Mexico.  Rothera’s paper analyzes their divergent experiences. Some allied themselves with Emperor Maximilian, but other professed to be apolitical and focused on business endeavors. Their experiences, in some cases, caused them to reevaluate their previous anti-Mexico sentiments.","‘Genls Price & Shelby & Hindman & Magruder & Judge Perkins – Govs Harris & Reynolds Are All Here Employed In Some Kind Of Work & All Doing Well’: Southern Exiles In Mexico After 1865"

First published by the New York headquarters of the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born (ACPFB) in 1959 as part of a petition to the United Nations protesting the treatment of the Mexican immigrant in the United States, this rather extraordinary document was the product of long collaboration between immigrant rights organizers on East and West coasts. Its repurposing by CASA indicates the persistence of this collaboration across time as well as space. The border-spanning prose of Our Badge of Infamy emanated from the multi-racial solidarity of the Popular Front.  The repurposing of this pamphlet by CASA, an organization central to the florescence of the Chicanx movement on the West Coast, evidences the historical trajectory of immigrant rights advocacy.  Historians have tended to think about the Old and New Lefts separately;  it is as if a historiographical 98th meridian divides class- and party- oriented multi-ethnic internationalism from the race, ethnicity and gender identity-based anti-colonialism of the New Social Movements. But the transmission of Our Badge of Infamy across this divide suggests that the ACPFB defied this divide by straddling it. Though as a Popular Front- allied organization the ACPFB suffered repression during the height of the Cold War , it survived  because the organization’s critique of police power and its defense of the rights of the foreign-born remained imperative and generative.

How might the oral history process itself influence subjects to reconsider their reluctance to talk about sexual secrets?  What, then, does the historian make of stories that have been told off the record, and how do those accounts influence our interpretations of our subjects' lives and times? What do we do with sexual secrets that have been revealed \"off the record\" by oral history subjects? Within the course of interviews, when and why do subjects rethink their decisions about sexual silences? This paper explores these questions through excerpts from two interviews conducted during the 1990s: in one, an initial self-censorship gave way within the course of the interview process to a later acknowledgment of a childhood sexual trauma; in the other, the revelation several years after the interview of an untold component of a sexual relationship revised the interpretation of the story and of the subject’s coming of age narrative. The paper attempts to open a conversation about patterns in sexual self-censorship and revelation in oral histories, particularly about sexual trauma, as well as to consider how historians can balance respect for our subjects' sexual privacy without reinforcing self-censorship.

Although disease outbreaks were common at the overcrowded and underfunded Indian school, this year was different: within a few months, more than a third of the student body was hospitalized and at least nine students died. The students suffered from a virulent and deadly new strain of influenza—one which traveled the globe in the lungs of soldiers and civilians dislocated by the First World War and killed approximately two percent of the world’s population. The effects of the pandemic—the deadliest in recorded history—were magnified at Haskell by personnel shortages among agency staff and medical professionals as well as by overcrowding that resulted from the closure of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania since many of those students transferred to Haskell just in time for the second wave of the pandemic. This paper traces the course of the influenza pandemic at Haskell and examines its consequences for students, their families, and school officials. By laying bare this institution during a moment of crisis, the pandemic provides a window on the administration of Indian boarding schools during the early twentieth century, how government officials introduced modern sanitation and medical practices to Native students, the relationships between students, parents, and agency staff, and the responsibility the federal government as guardian had to its Indian wards during the period before Indians were officially granted U.S. citizenship in 1924.

This traditional nationally-centered focus on domestic political battles, however, obscures an important paradox: at the very moment that the New Deal state was most in flux at home, US global power was reshaping social governance abroad, and in some cases left reforms that exceeded what was politically possible in the US. This paper seeks to fill this gap by examining the largely untold story of social security reform during the 1945 – 1952 US occupation of Japan. Drawing on previously untapped government records, memoirs, and personal collections, I trace the activities of the Social Security Division within the occupation, which was staffed with a cadre of young and idealistic officers, many with experience in the Social Security Administration and other New Deal agencies. They saw Japan as a technician’s dream, a social tabula rasa onto which they could project their vision of universal, comprehensive social insurance and social assistance. Directly supported and advised by experts from the Social Security Administration like Arthur Altmeyer and Isadore Falk, the officers of the Social Security Division demilitarized Japanese social policy, instituted new forms of social assistance, enshrined social security as a right in the 1947 constitution of Japan, and recommended an integrated, compulsory social security system that would integrate health insurance; many of these reforms exist to this day. Although these administrators and officers (often explicitly) sought to institute reform that was becoming increasingly untenable at home, they could not long escape domestic battles over social policy in the US. In 1947, they came under congressional investigation on charges that they were attempting to foist universal healthcare on the unwilling Japanese people. The next year, the American Medical Association sent a highly publicized mission to Japan to recommend private, voluntary, employer-based healthcare on the then-emerging American model. Occupied Japan thus became an unlikely proxy battleground for US policy debates. The result, I show, helped to shape the trajectory of social policy in both Japan and the US. Ultimately, this story cuts to the heart of what sorts of social rights that both public and private US actors would seek to espouse and impose at the dawn of the Cold War and US global power. It helps to challenge outmoded, unexamined assumptions about US social policy exceptionalism: rather than looking at what didn’t emerge politically in the postwar US, I instead examine the ways US global power did shape social-political landscapes abroad. It also shows that social policies can flow across national boundaries not only through transnational exchange of models, but also through conquest, coercion, and uneven balances of power.

The ideas of the intellectual Ricardo Flores Mag6n shaped and influenced residents and transients on both sides of the international line between the United States and Mexico. Numerous branches of the Partido Liberal Mexicano espoused Magonismo ideas about worker dignity, livable wages, and women's rights and began to dot the landscape along the border in the early 1900s. These ideas were expressed in the numerous uprisings during the Mexican Revolution of 1910. It was after the Mexican Revolution, that a former Francisco Villa soldier, Esteban Mendez Guerra, formed an anarcho-syndicalist organization in Tampico that included the active participation of women. Among these women was Caritina Piña, who served as the head of correspondence. While the historiography on Mexican (and Mexican American) anarchism has focused mainly on Mexican male actors in the production of anarcho-syndicalist thought, women such as Caritina Piña directly sustained the global labor movement through her active role in spreading ideology while she developed a transnational network of women that helped to produce knowledge about the movement itself.

Yet, by exploring transnational medical debates over the causes of yellow fever in the 1790s, this paper argues that physicians played a crucial role in weakening the transnational abolitionist movement at the turn of the nineteenth century. In 1795, a proslavery British physician, Dr. Colin Chisholm, argued that the recent yellow fever outbreaks in Philadelphia, New York, and the West Indies stemmed from a contaminated ship coming back from Sierra Leone, the newly established abolitionist colony.  At the time, abolitionists in both the United States and Britain hoped that Sierra Leone’s success would prove that paying Africans to cultivate cash crops on their own continent would obviate the need of slave labor in the West Indies and southern United States.  Chisholm’s theory thus tainted Sierra Leone and the broader abolitionist movement for which it stood. Abolitionist-physicians in the United States published lengthy refutations of Chisholm’s theory in the nation’s leading medical journals, highlighting its blatant anti-abolitionist agenda. Yet their abolitionist-physician allies in Britain were decidedly more muted, suggesting that national politics formed a powerful antidote to a movement that functioned best with a united transnational front.  Of course, many reasons explain the failure of the abolitionist movement in the 1790s. But the role medical science played in shaping its fate demands greater attention.","Antislavery Science: Yellow Fever And The Failure Of The Abolitionist Movement In The 1790S"

Historians have argued that Pentecostal interest in American politics is a recent development and side-effect of their proximity to evangelical Christians. Pentecostals began as apolitical members of society, the logic goes, but they as showed an interest in middleclass respectability, they took on evangelical and fundamentalist approaches to social and political engagement. Indeed, the notion that early Pentecostal practitioners were apolitical or Anabaptist in their initial approach to politics is a truism in the study of Pentecostalism and American religious history. Scholars of global Pentecostalism (in particular students of Latin American Pentecostalism) critique this claim, but the idea that Pentecostals in the United States began as apolitical endures in scholarly and popular descriptions of the movement. This paper surveys twenty-six prominent English and Spanish language Pentecostal publications in the United States from 1890-1930 on the subject of women in the public sphere to demonstrate that, from their inception, Pentecostals were politically-minded. These theological and political conversations about the place of women in (or out of) American society and in (or out of) the pulpit illuminate how politics shape(d) the trajectory of Pentecostalism (and vice versa). I hope to conclude by discussing how viewing the early Pentecostal movement as political from the outset can enrich historians’ understanding of the relationship between politics and religion in the United States.

A former contractor turned community organizer in the late 1960s, Scott blossomed as an activist at a time when Black Nationalists increasingly demanded community control of construction jobs in Seattle.  In sharp contrast to historical accounts that link Black Power to racial separatism, this paper examines a unique moment in Scott’s political development, one that clearly demonstrated his openness to multiracial solidarity.  By drawing upon a rich archive of publications and poetry that Scott produced in the mid 1970s, I unpack an analogue that Scott continually referenced throughout his writing and speeches: the New Buffalo Soldier.  In both his writings and speeches, Scott likened Black activists narrowly concerned with their own racial group as yet another manifestation of African American Soldiers who fought of the side of manifest destiny in the 1800s.  To give further context to Scott’s analysis, this paper pays particular attention to his own history of military service in Okinawa and Vietnam, as well as his interactions with Native American activists in the American Indian Movement. In doing so, I link the study of the Black Power Era to that of U.S. Empire.  More precisely, I reveal the connections between Scott’s Black radical imagination and his exposure to different histories of U.S. Colonialism: Imperial wars of aggression in the Asia-Pacific and the Red Power Movement’s confrontation with settler colonialism in the Pacific Northwest.

While scholars have examined the possibilities and limits of laws and policies designed to make public spaces and employment opportunities more equitable, we know comparatively little about how particular laborers engaged desegregation or new protections from gender discrimination. Drawing on archival research and oral histories, Karissa Haugeberg investigates how nurses engaged the movement for racial justice in previously segregated American hospitals during the 1960s. This paper engages the panel’s theme of gender and conservatism by elucidating how members of the female-dominated nursing profession enacted and contested progressive public policies. On the eve of 1960, 94-percent of southern hospitals and 17-percent of northern hospitals remained segregated, either by refusing to admit African Americans altogether or by treating white and African American patients on separate wards. Over the course of the decade, hospital administrators, fearing litigation and the loss of federal money, responded to a host of public policies, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Social Security Amendments of 1965, by revising hiring practices and patient care. By placing professional women at the center of this study, Haugeberg seeks to reveal how ordinary Americans understood, enacted, or contested concepts of equality, obligation, and fairness, and also how social justice movements reconfigured the American workplace.","Civil Rights On The Hospital Floor: American Nursing And Hospital Integration In The Deep South"

Slavery and capitalism studies link the removal of Indians from their ancestral homelands in the Southeast with the expansion of slavery in the Deep South.  On the other hand, less historical attention has been given to how Native American slaveholders contributed to the growth of the institution not only by their leaving, but also by their coming to the southwestern part of the United States. Therefore, considering Indian and black forced migrations in tandem, instead of as separate and pivotal traumatic events, can illuminate on topics such as Native American involvement in the market economy and how conceptions of blackness and notions of Native sovereignty and futurity formed, collided, and reconciled during the mid-19th century.Without considering bondpeople’s forced removal to Indian Territory and other areas of the western United States, we have an incomplete understanding of chattel slavery’s massive expansion during the antebellum period and of Native participation in this practice. This paper will complicate the dominant narrative of slavery as a black-white binary that occurred primarily in the southeastern part of the United States. Native Americans were principal, not peripheral, historical actors in the institution of slavery in the Southwest as well as the domestic slave trade.

This research provides a comprehensive analysis of the Ventura School for Girls, the first reformatory established for girls committed to the state of California in 1913. By examining California state archival materials, this study argues that from the 1910s to the 1940s the state played the most vital role in segregating and containing girl deviants and establishing girl typologies, a framework in which certain types of girls were viewed as less likely to reform. During the 1940s, these typologies worked to entrap pachuca girls in the Ventura School. ","Containing Girl Deviants: A History Of The Ventura School For Girls, 1910S-1940S"

She could have run for the U.S. Senate from New York or headed up a national political action committee. She could have started a foundation or led a nonprofit.  Instead, she went back to the only permanent home she ever had—her cottage at Val-Kill in Hyde Park, New York. There, in a reconverted furniture factory, she created her own version of the beloved community living out the values she espoused—simplicity, respect for others, enlightened reason/discourse rather than emotion, living on the land, diversity, and involvement in local, state, national and international affairs. In the process, Val-Kill became more than a home; it became a laboratory and a school for democracy, the place where Eleanor Roosevelt affirmed her values and imparted them to others in person or via her syndicated newspaper column, My Day. There she devised strategies to insure the creation and passage of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, advised Democratic presidential candidates Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy and demonstrated the efficacy of the democratic way of life to world leaders such as India’s Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. Val-Kill was also the place where she hosted picnics for troubled youngsters, met with myriad groups of workers, students, and foreign guests and wrote her books and her columns. This paper will use Eleanor Roosevelt’s My Day column to discuss the centrality of Val-Kill as the site of and the wellspring for her post-White House career.","Eleanor Roosevelt’s Val-Kill: House, Home, Laboratory And School For Democracy, 1945–1962"

During the last third of the twentieth century, countless industries closed down their doors as Southern California joined the national shift from a Fordist to a Postfordist economy. A myriad of factories and the blue-collar white workers employed in their work floors, left the Los Angeles region during this time. Yet the population of the metropolis did not contract in size. In fact, Los Angeles continued to grow and solidified its status as the second biggest metropolitan region in the nation. The sustaining and growth of Los Angeles was driven by the arrival of thousands of migrants from Asia and Latin American. For members of the latter group, their migrations from Latin American were the product of the reshaping of the global economy that embraced neoliberal policies and domestic political turmoil attendant to Cold War conflicts.Cities such Huntington Park and South Gate South East Los Angeles, which were founded as white suburbs turned into Latina/o communities during the last third of the twentieth century.  The exodus of white residents resulted in a dilapidated municipal infrastructure and decaying public schools that proved ill-prepared to serve the new residents. In the absence of public spaces or youth-oriented establishments, by the late 1980s and early 1990s Latina/o youth began to host music shows in a number of improvised venues such as restaurants, quinceañera halls, auto shops, timeworn veterans’ hall, among other places. These gatherings featured bands part of a transnational music genre known as Rock en Español that combined British and American rock styles with Latin American sounds and gained massive popularity as a Pan Latin-American genre by the early 1990s. The appearance of these improntu venues was vehemently scrutinized by local government officials and police agencies as these often defied regulation or lacked the necesary permits to operate. Nonetheless, these ephemeral forums served as organizing spaces where youth developed local, regional, and transnational networks of communication in which information flowed multidirectionally. These networks produced enduring political participation among many of participants at different local, regional and transnational levels to denounce immigrant bashing electoral initiatives such as Proposition 187 in 1994, as well as succesful efforts to stave off the opening of polluting power plants in the city of South Gate in 1999, and to connect the transnational pro-democracy efforts in Mexico. Hence, this presentation will consider how the creation of youth-oriented Latina/o social spaces were part of collective actions within South East L.A. empowered residents to push back against structural marginalization, while proposing generative conceptions of participatory citizenship that include migrants (regardless of legal status) as part body politic of Southern California by the new millennium.","Ephemeral Forums, Enduring Communities:  Latina/O Community Building And Belonging In 1990S South East Los Angeles"

Once prominently defined as the Hero of Gettysburg, Meade is now commonly obscured by the notoriety of Generals Grant and Sherman and Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas Stonewall Jackson.  This was not always the case, however.  When George Gordon Meade died on November 6, 1872, scores of fellow military personnel and grateful citizens wrote his family expressing their condolences and regret.  The ensuing years, and ultimately decades, brought forth a flurry of activity to memorialize and commemorate Pennsylvania’s famed son.  In addition to the written narrative, Meade’s legacy emerged through another form of history, in the form of memorials on the commemorative landscape.  Ultimately Americans initiated efforts to place memorials to Meade at three prominent locations, Gettysburg National Military Park, the location of the general’s most famed victory, Fairmont Park in Philadelphia, the general’s hometown, and on the Capitol Grounds in Washington, D.C.  This paper seeks to highlight the prominent place that Meade held among his contemporaries and succeeding generations and in doing so reasserts the Hero of Gettysburg to his central, defining role in the Civil War and American memory.

After quickly outlining how the impoverished situation of New York City plays a part in the very existence of a body of films made with a very reduced budget, I will move on to show how these films, in turn, document this same economic situation of near bankruptcy and by doing so take a political stance. Going one step further, some films clearly criticize the police and political elite:  Black Box (Beth B and Scott B, 1979) and Police State (Nick Zedd, 1987) denounce political violence and torture, others are more centered on political corruption such as G-Man (Beth B and Scott B, 1978). In examining these and other films of the era, this paper weighs the extent to which  the representations  given to the spectator work as an eye opener, as a real political encounter that informs and educates the viewer. The films will be studied both as political acts per se and in their links to practical political action. The paper will analyze in detail the mixture of jokes, pranks and stark violence that these films contain as I contend that this blend enables political topics to flow between the conditions of production of the films, the onscreen representation and  practical political action.

It will focus on the approach taken by Bruce Mohler, Director of the National Catholic Welfare Conference’s Immigration Bureau, focusing on his attention to the separation of Maltese families as a result of restrictions imposed by the Immigration Act of 1924. Working at the frontlines of the new Restriction State, Catholic social activists were confronted by the consequences of a National Origins Quota System that made it extremely difficult for the wives and children of non-Citizen aliens from areas with small quota numbers to join their husbands and fathers in the U.S. Voluntary agency staff were best positioned to convey these realities to policymakers. In this context, Maltese authorities were granting passports only to those women and children whose husbands and fathers were already in the U.S. so as to give these individuals priority within the small quota allocated to this British Crown Colony. Mohler praised this policy that recognized the moral and humane needs of immigrant families in the U.S.  This paper shows how an important voice at the front lines of immigration restriction accepted, when necessary, corollary emigration restriction as an extension of the new American Restriction State.

Following the arrival of Europeans early in the sixteenth century, the Ais used these same maritime skills to acquire goods, peoples, and even parts of the shattered ships that then washed ashore.  The Ais flourished from this dynamic maritime economy that combined existing and novel uses of the materials available in the local Atlantic commons.  This multi-step strategy of indigenous wrecking remained remarkably stable over several centuries, as evident by comparing the 1571 and 1696 shipwrecks of Spaniard and St. Augustine founder Pedro Menéndez de Avilés with Anglo-Jamaican and later Philadelphian merchant Jonathan Dickinson.  Through their exploitation of these goods and peoples from European shipwrecks, coupled with their careful manipulation of Atlantic and indigenous contacts, the Ais polity established an expansive domain during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including influence in at least thirty-nine towns in east central Florida.  This Ais Domain, and the Ais themselves, disappeared in the eighteenth century.  Despite holding substantial sway in peninsula Florida for two centuries, this Ais Domain figures little in most Florida histories.  The Ais and many of their fellow indigenous Floridians are often a mere footnote of presence before they vanish.  This work, then, is an act of dual recovery, recovering the Ais Domain, which the Ais themselves forged through their recoveries from wrecks.","Of All Who Have Ever Been Wrecked Here, On One Has Ever Escaped Death Or Capture: Indigenous Wrecking And The Post-Contact Rise Of The Ais"
"<h5><i>Mr. Aaron Hall (UC Berkeley)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2018-04-13</h5><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 13:00 to 14:30</h5><p><h5><b>Id:</b> 2637</h5><p>This paper considers the relationship between the genesis of American constitutionalism and political struggles over slavery in the antebellum United States. The country’s constitutional Founding features prominently in scholarship, as well as in contemporary political discourse and strands of jurisprudence. But the origins of such investment in original visions, laden with expectations for political and legal legitimation, do not. This paper suggests that constitutional veneration was generatively conjoined with bitter conflict over slavery. The former was constitutive of the latter, while the framework of veneration structured debates over slavery under law.In antebellum American, the public learned to regard the Founding as a repository of authoritative visions, intentions and binding promises that prescribed terms of a national future. To negotiate the fraught politics of slavery, people celebrated, grasped for and wielded the cultural and legal power of the past against present crises. In doing so, Americans forged an emotional popular constitutional life defined by divisive reverence, one that crossed distinctions among jurisdictions, parties, race, gender and sentiment. The American public spoke a common constitutional vernacular, sharing rhetorical and conceptual practices: they invoked meanings, understandings, and values attributed to the Founding, and yet different communities articulated dramatically divergent narratives that left little room for compromise beyond those asserted to have once been made by national fathers. After a brief introduction on the production of constitutional reverence between the Treaty of Ghent (1815) and tariff nullification crisis (1831-33), this paper discusses the promulgation of clashing claims upon the Founding during the following decades. It argues that debates over slavery fostered public inculcation and rehearsal of reverence and deference to an authoritative constitutional past. Political movements exercised the Founding’s power as a venerated object offensively to govern distant bodies and defensively to deflect others’ efforts to govern life close to home. Drawing from judicial, electoral and civic discourse, the paper illustrates how the Founding became a shield or sword in the hands of slaveholders, abolitionists, unionists and disunionists. It explains deployment of historically reverent constitutionalism to defend antislavery petitioning and press, slave state sovereignty and personal liberty laws; then it pivots to show opposing depictions of framers’ designs applied to slave rendition, commerce powers, and federal territories. These instances demonstrate the importance of constitutional veneration in tactics and consciousness; to denigrate the work of the national fathers was to cede legal-moral ground, as higher-law proponents and Constitution critics found. Efficacious movements located rallying cries within the spirit of revered fathers. Yet subjective visions meant that one community’s shield was another’s sword, dissonance that fueled polarization. By developing constitutional attachment as the heart of an ambiguous nationalism, conceiving that revolutionary fathers imparted authoritative meaning, extending that meaning to promises concerning slavery, people perceived a deeper constitutional treachery in opponents and heightened sanction for their own positions. By example, the paper makes the case for recognizing the role of slavery in galvanizing the development of American constitutional culture, and for reintegrating constitutionalism into the thick of cultural, intellectual and political scholarship on the early republic.","Our Palladium Of Liberties: Slavery And The Weaponized Constitutional Founding, 1833-1860 "

The U.S. birth-rate had fallen by half since 1800, from 7 children per couple to around 3.5. Its apparent trajectory towards zero, the young president warned, promised to extinguish the American experiment. Roosevelt’s warning touched off a decades-long public debate during which thousands of Americans asked themselves whether small families were selfish, as Roosevelt claimed, or economically rational; whether they part of the good or bad in modernity; and whether a good person owed any reproductive debt to God, nature, tribe or nation.                This paper will examine the conservative side of this civic debate. Pro-natal conservatives saw in mass birth control a fatal paradox at the heart of American liberalism. The proud individualism that had built Anglo-America also threatened to tear it down, condemning its builders and their ideas to extinction. To avoid this fate, moralists asked their fellow Americans to rethink the strong cultural association of small families with modernity, rejecting the common assumption that each of those phenomena flowed benignly from the other, and demanding the subordination of modern comforts to the primitive and natural laws of existence. In the process they built a pro-natal mysticism, which asserted that the liberalism of rights—rather than duties—was fundamentally incompatible with human survival over time. This biological conservatism retains an enduring significance in global debates over reproductive ethics.","Race Suicide And Procreative Mysticism In America, 1900-1940"

These new visions responded to the movement of ideas, print, bodies, and microbes, as Americans worked to understand the unexpected movement of a quick and merciless pandemic over the decades that followed. One important strain of this imagining connected the arrival and spread of cholera to the ills of racial slavery. As the initial arrival of cholera on the American continent (for the first time ever) came quickly on the heels of Nat Turner’s execution and the restrictive legislation that followed, prominent African Americans and abolitionists—including Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Martin Delany—saw the disease as moral retribution for the traffic in human bodies. This equation was certainly a powerful social, political, and rhetorical move, but it was also a medical one. In this paper I will focus on the work of Stowe and Delany to show how their understanding of cholera prompted them to craft a radical medical geography that upended prevailing theories of disease.

Many former Peace Corps workers were at the forefront of efforts to embrace and manage diversity in education and in business and organizational life. Undergirding this movement were concepts of cultural sensitivity and inter-cultural communication that were first put into practice, on a wide scale, by the Peace Corps, which saw these as necessary skills for Americans navigating an increasingly globalized world. Why and how were ideas first deployed in the context of American foreign aid applied to the problem of social difference within the U.S.?The Peace Corps stressed the relativism of cultural norms at the same time that it sought to ensure U.S. hegemony in the so-called Third World. A similar conflict was built into domestic liberal multiculturalism—that of accommodating difference within the overriding framework of the nation. This paper will interrogate the motivations behind the concept of cultural sensitivity and explore how notions of state power influenced its theory and practice, at home and abroad. It will also look to Peace Corps volunteers themselves as agents of both foreign and domestic policy. How did the American state’s understanding of culture affect volunteers’ experience in the field and how did volunteers’ field experience shape or otherwise challenge that understanding? How did volunteers’ encounters with foreign people abroad translate into institutional change at home?","Seeing Culture Everywhere: Peace Corps Service And The Challenge Of Diversity At Home"

In this talk, I will argue, that a cohort of nineteenth-century professional blackface minstrels, who published their routines as tripartite plays for amateur use, simultaneously founded the Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks, providing an essential, national framework for disseminating, distributing, and maintaining their culturally conceptualized ideas of American racial identity. Marketed nationally as local entertainment, their nearly ten thousand published minstrel plays—which are the bedrock of my research—are revisionist political treatises documenting the material remnants of white supremacy’s intellectual life after the Civil War. More importantly to the methodological concerns of this panel, blackface shows, when produced in printed form during Reconstruction, were understood as intellectual documents that accurately represented black life and expressive culture authentically to white audiences who studied them to physically embody and perform a specific understanding of blackness. I will grapple with how contemporary readers understood them as authoritative studies of black life by placing them in conversation with other white produced documents they were based off of: fugitive slave ads detailing slaves’ musical and instrumental talents and ethnographic studies white actors made of slave life to re-appropriate on stage.

The Confederadas newspaper, España Libre (1939-1977), revitalized anarchist and antifascist culture with the publication of short stories, poetry, essays, satirical chronicles, caricatures, and the reviews of popular theater. The presentation focuses on one of the most esteemed editors of the newspaper, Jesús González Malo, who had been a Spanish Civil War militiaman.

Understanding the cultural, social, and political factors that inhibit disclosure is key to both identifying and interpreting silences, and to establishing a foundation for greater trust and candor. Of equal importance is knowing when to let silence prevail. Memory is the stuff of identity, and when it threatens one’s sense of self, or relationships between self and others, it may be suppressed, censored, or reshaped—all for good reasons. Breaking the silence can be therapeutic, but historians aren’t trained therapists. Drawing upon interviews from my books Abiding Courage and Daughters of Aquarius, this paper will discuss how to interrogate, and in some cases, delicately push through the silences in women’s stories.

These two communities faced similar challenges in the Gilded Age and Progressive Era as they marketed themselves to potential Northern investors and residents. Promoters for both strove to counter negative perceptions of the region based on climate, geography, and regional history. Both continue, in the present day, to craft compelling historical narratives to brand themselves to tourists, businesses, and residents, and both are part of the national Main Street Center, which makes historic preservation a key element of development and revitalization. Contemporary efforts to market these spaces incorporate historical forms that shape downtown landscapes: murals, plaques, streetscapes, museums. The narratives they present resonate—and reproduce—those created by the earliest boosters. Both the contemporary stories and the historic templates they reference rely on a series of elisions and perspectives that mythologize elements of the past and elide complex or controversial histories related to race and class. In DeLand, contemporary historical narratives emphasize white pioneer stories, with only passing reference to the African Americans who labored in the area’s turpentine and citrus industries. In Thomasville, Georgia, the revived Main Street and nearby neighborhoods restore the Victorian charm that, along with nearby plantations, is the town’s tourism draw. In both communities, alternate histories exist slightly off the beaten track, metaphorizing the historic relationships between black and white, privileged and working-class residents.","The Best Place On Earth: Narratives Of Southern Town Promotion And Identity"

As the U.S. girded for a Cold War against the erstwhile Soviet allies, the IWO also opposed a permanent military-industrial wartime footing that it argued diverted resources from more productive and egalitarian economic activity. Local IWO lodges wanted to know why the U.S. had the capacity to bring Nazi scientists to America to work on weapons programs, but could not find the means to enact universal health care or defend unions from Taft-Hartley assaults.

Lala’s The Philippine Islands (1898) cast Philippine nature as rich but untapped due to the effete rule of Spain. He hoped the American intervention would bring three figures of modern enterprise – the scientist, engineer, and practical economist – to the former colony to discover what the Philippines have to add to the useful productions of the world (156). Like many wealthy and well-educated Filipinos collectively known as ilustrados, Lala was a liberal internationalist who wielded depictions of tropical nature to criticize Spain and promote foreign trade and investment. What was a nationalist and cosmopolitan strategy developed during long sojourns and exiles in Europe became, in an American context, an invitation to empire. This paper uses Lala and his travel writings as a lens into the tense politics of colonial collaboration in the US occupation of the Philippines and in the former Spanish empire more broadly. While Lillian Guerra and Francisco Scarano have called figures like Lala in the Caribbean pro-imperialist nationalists, this paper instead asks why the specter of American intervention seemed promising to liberal elites. How did their expectations contribute to American ideas about development and enterprise in the Pacific and Caribbean? What does this brief moment tell us about the multidirectional flow of images, expectations, and ideas in the shaping of the global south in the American imaginary?","The Whole Country Is A Virgin Mine: Philippine Depictions Of Nature And Nation Before And After 1898"

Writing to inhabitants of his own Albemarle County on 3 Apr. 1809 he confided that the pomp, the turmoil, the bustle & splendour of office, have drawn but deeper sighs for the tranquil & irresponsible occupations of private life, and I gladly lay down the distressing burthen of power. Jefferson never again held a public office, never traveled outside Virginia, and avoided entering public debates. Jefferson did, however, continue to toil during the last decade of his life as he spearheaded the founding of the University of Virginia. Believing education to be imperative for the good of society and of wise government, he conceived of and drafted the legislation that would establish the state school, designed its buildings, recruited its faculty, and served as rector until his death. In this paper I will look at Jefferson’s retirement years and how he balanced his desire for the tranquil & irresponsible occupations of private life with the labor-intensive public act of promoting state-sponsored education. At times he worked to keep his role as quiet as possible in order to protect his privacy and to minimize possible negativity toward the infant school stemming from his role as a polarizing figure. Yet Jefferson gladly ranked this work among his highest achievements when he instructed that Father of the University of Virginia be inscribed on his epitaph.","Thomas Jefferson And The University Of Virginia: The Final Public Act Of A Private Man"

I will illustrate both the United States Information Service’s (USIS) and the Thai military-monarchical government’s roles in promoting anti-communism and the benefits of having America as an ally. In the first stage, I am looking at the formation of a new U.S.-Thai relationship during the years of 1957 to 1963. I argue that the perceived threat of communism helped make the two countries into stronger allies than in previous years. By 1964 and 1965, the Vietnam conflict had drawn the United States, militarily, into the region. Washington turned to Thailand as a base for U.S. air operations. My main argument for this period focuses on the USIS and Thai government’s efforts to convince the people of the dangers of communism and its potentiality of growing in Thailand. U.S.-Thai public diplomacy officials portrayed Thai support for American military intervention in Vietnam as a national security necessity. Eventually in 1966, the United States requested the Thai government send a military contingency to Vietnam as part of Lyndon B. Johnson’s rally around the flag campaign. The USIS and Thai military-monarchical government created public campaigns to develop support for Thailand’s involvement in the war. They focused on communism’s incompatibility with the Thailand’s cultural history and its desire for economic progress. I will conclude with discussing some of the results and consequences from the anti-communist policies.","U.s.-Thai Public Diplomacy In Thailand: The United States Information Service’s And Thai Military-Monarchical Government’s Anti-Communist And Pro-Vietnam War Activities, 1957-1968"

But looking backward can also generate powerful models of progress and peace. In the mid-twentieth century black and white socialists seeking radical economic and social change drew from nineteenth-century utopian communities to model a new world in the present. These communities were, in a sense, a way to represent both the American past and its potential future. Pacifist communities created cooperative farms in the Deep South, urban Ashrams in the Northeast, and interracial churches on the West Coast. They promoted communal living, cooperative economics and a new form of radical pacifism that became an essential tool in the civil rights movement.Father Divine, for example, was particularly enamored with Mother Ann Lee and the Shakers. In 1936 he founded a series of rural interracial cooperatives, which he named the Promised Land, in a region of rural New York where the Shakers had begun their utopian experiment. Ashrams in Newark and Harlem in the 1940s modeled themselves after Gandhian communities, but also after early nineteenth century utopian societies such as Ephrata. And the Delta Cooperative farm in Mississippi was explicitly modeled after nineteenth-century Owenite cooperatives such as New Harmony. In these spaces activists lived communally and honed their skills in nonviolent direct action. And they provided models for a new generation of utopian thinkers who emerged decades later in the New Left.

With the assistance of a variety of different sources, including The Bay View Magazine, John Lawson Stoddard’s lecture series, and Burton Holmes’s travelogue collection, these clubwomen took part in imaginary journeys, which allowed them to glide from land to land without having to leave the comfort of their own communities. Following the conclusion of the Spanish-American War of 1898 and the creation of America’s overseas empire, they began taking imaginary journeys throughout Latin America, and in turn, quickly became active participants in the U.S. colonial experience. During their journeys, American clubwomen came into contact with the region’s customs, peoples, pasts, culinary traditions, major cities, as well as its industrial capabilities. Using these imaginary journeys throughout Latin America as a lens to increase our understanding of how Gilded Age and Progressive Era women perceived America’s role in global affairs during the first quarter of the twentieth century, this paper will ask how American clubwomen perceived Latin Americans? What racial and cultural similarities did they draw and what differences did they find? Perhaps most importantly, how did their evaluations of the region affect how they engaged with American empire building throughout the time period under discussion?

Vitalists held that a self-activating life force animated the tiniest particles of matter, causing these to produce all the bio-chemical processes of life.  Some vitalists also believed that the smallest particles are made of fundamentally the same stuff, and that they eventually cycle through all the life forms in the universe.  One conclusion from this cosmology of eternal matter was heretical: that no transcendent Creator-God existed.  Other heresies followed: Jesus was not divine; heaven and hell were inventions.  Dr. Phineas Hedges in New York State combined medical vitalism with such religious heresy.  His overt disregard for Christian beliefs provoked fear and loathing in his orthodox neighbors.  After Hedges and some friends engaged in a mockery of communion by offering a wafer to a dog, reports flew that the miscreants soon suffered the wrath of God.  When Hedges died unexpectedly in 1799, his opponents clucked and nodded in relief.  But in other ways Hedges was harder to dismiss.  His vitalism also supported his conception of the American Republic as an organic whole in which all people were kin.  Vitalist insights spurred generosity, Hedges maintained, and a virtuous Republic required such a radically increased benevolence.  Dr. Hedges was part of a small but headstrong community of people who braided together the concepts of vitalism, virtue, and irreligion in the early Republic.","‘Benevolence Shall Gush In Limpid Streams From The Heart’: Vitalist Science, Republican Virtue, And Religious Infidelity In The 1790S."

Grant’s upcoming visit to London. Pierrepont asked how Grant was to be received by the British elite and insisted that Grant receive the same consideration as the Ex-Chief Ruler of an Empire. Derby, noting that an ex-president had no diplomatic precedence in America, much less in Britain, observed that Once an Emperor always an Emperor. Pierrepont replied then, once a President always a President. For the first time a former American president was treated, not only as a statesman, but as a former head-of-state.  This episode highlights the uniqueness of Ulysses S. Grant’s post-presidential career. While former presidents had traveled abroad prior to Grant’s trip, none sought or received the reception afforded to Grant.  As his engagements with diplomatic elites grew in number, Grant found that his opinion on world matters carried weight.  By the end of his trip he believed that his experiences around the world had afforded him an opportunity to help expand the United States’ economic reach into the burgeoning Asian markets.  Grant immersed himself in the economic and political issues of the world, believing that his newfound knowledge would help him achieve a third term in the Executive Mansion.  This paper will argue that Grant’s world tour helped to lay the groundwork for United States imperialism in Asia, strengthened his claim for a third term, and buoyed the reputation of the American presidency worldwide.","‘More For Our Country Than For Me’: The Diplomatic Mission Of Ulysses S.

Like all previous Bureau Chiefs, Eliot was highly educated, unmarried and, like many of her Bureau colleagues, she maintained an intimate relationship with another woman.  As Chief, she worked closely with women’s reform organizations.  Many of those groups had been in the forefront of Progressive and New Deal reform and their members vigorously defended Children’s Bureau interests.  Eliot, however, was the last chief to fit this model.  Although previous chiefs handpicked their successors, when Eliot resigned in 1957, she was replaced with Katharine Oettinger, who was recruited over the objections of Eliot and voluntary women’s organizations.  During Oettinger’s tenure, the Children’s Bureau lost status and was dismantled in 1969.These setbacks, for Eliot, the Children’s Bureau, and aging women reformers, demonstrate how age, gender, and sexuality shaped the shift from Progressive and New Deal reform to Cold War liberalism.  Newspapers emphasized Eliot’s grandmotherliness, her unattractiveness, and her childlessness, perceptions that reflected assumptions about sexuality and age.  Other government welfare officials disparaged her as too aggressive in defending nostalgic ideas about public welfare.  In replacing her, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare made motherhood a job requirement and favored Oettinger because she promised to be a team player with liberal men in government.  Overall, Eliot was portrayed by colleagues and in public forums as a relic of an earlier era, an old woman with old ideas, blocking the path to modern, liberal reform.","‘The Last Of The Dedicated Old Maids’: Aging Maternalist Progressives In A Liberal Era"

In The Long List of Glory, I argue that while faithful to the historical record Douglass’s trope lionized soldiers’ sacrifice to combat white supremacy and achieve liberation. African American intellectuals from Reconstruction through the Great War employed Douglass’s framework in their histories to communicate particular political platforms; each intellectual’s historical reinterpretation reflected distinct programs for attaining freedom. While accurately describing black service, I contend that by glorifying war and using battlefield sacrifice as the cornerstone of their activism these intellectuals confined the scope of emancipation.","‘The Long List Of Glory’: African American Intellectuals, Civil War History, And The Struggle For Freedom From Reconstruction To The Great War"
