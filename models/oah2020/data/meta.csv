Interestingly, the ICW did not create a standing committee on womens suffrage until its 1904 congress in Berlin, Germany. Yet, ICW leaders saw womens suffrage as central for their endeavors. This paper will explore why other issues seemed to be higher on the ICW agenda and why the council decided to promote womens suffrage in 1904.</p>","At Best A Very Controversial Issue: The International Council Of Women And The Suffrage Question"

Carters successor, Ronald Reagan, sought new ways to curtail the perceived threat of increasing arrivals of Cubans, Haitians, and Central Americans to the United States, even as Reagans hard-line Cold War foreign policies simultaneously exacerbated their displacement. This migration crisis played out on many levels: in transnational solidarity movements and in the resistance and uprisings of migrants held in U.S. detention centers, in an upsurge in Ku Klux Klan activity and xenophobia in American communities, in the news media, and in White House policy deliberations. This paper focuses on local and national responses to the detention of Cubans at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, to reveal how the spectacle of the Mariel Cuban migration became a specter wielded by the Reagan administration to develop its Mass Immigration Emergency Plan. Together, new policies of mandatory detention, interdiction, border militarization under the war on drugs, and private prison contracting ushered in a new era of crimmigration and buttressed the detention systems subsequent growth.</p>","Here, A Cuban Is Mud: A Refugee Crisis In Arkansas And The Rise Of Reagan's Detention Regime"

This paper explores the place of big band jazz within Lockes broader theory of black musical development. Even as he praised jazz artists such as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Jimmie Lunceford, Locke argued that jazz classics were at best a transitional phase on the way to a truly representative American music. I argue that Lockes conflicted position on jazz reflects a broader ambivalence toward musical improvisation within Lockes Eurocentric theory of black musical progress. Despite his belief in its fervor and freshness, Locke framed jazz improvisation as an undisciplined effusion that must be put under control via the rational and disciplined arts of arranging and composition. Through an analysis of Lockes commentary on jazz in <i>The Negro and His Music</i>, this paper will show how Lockes discussion of jazz fit into larger narratives of assimilation and black progress.</p>","Jazz Of The Better Sort: Alain Locke On Jazz And The Maturation Of Black Music"

That this victory was spearheaded by an African American–led coalition steeped in several decades of domestic civil rights struggle as well as deep engagement with Africa since the beginning of decolonization points to a key paradox in the fortunes of U.S. progressive politics.  On the one hand, nothing in the political firmament proved more of a stimulant than the quest for racial justice and equal rights; on the other hand, the leaders of progressive coalitions such as the Free South Africa Movement and its Washington D.C.–based spearhead, TransAfrica, proved less adept at fulfilling their own more radical visions of social change.

Her experience at MIT as a student was one of simultaneous exclusion and inclusion. A few MIT professors, like her eventual husband, mining professor Robert Richards, were willing to work with the new female student and admired her skills in chemistry. Even still, Ellen Richards was excluded from participating in the all-male field schools in the summer, and the MIT Board also denied her pursuit of a PhD in Chemistry as they did not want a woman to receive the first advanced degree awarded at MIT. Imagining those women students who would come after her, Richards used the institutional power of MIT and her connections to orchestrate scientific and educational programs for women. She formed the Womens Laboratory at MIT, operational from 1876 to 1883. In 1882 MIT began formally admitting female students, and Richards acted as an unofficial dean of women students. Despite Richardss progress in creating a space for women to study science at MIT, female enrollment never achieved educational parity with men during Richardss lifetime. Until the 1940s, the number of women enrolled remained less than 1% of the student body and no womens dorms existed. This paper will analyze how Ellen Richards and other women students at MIT understood their unequal access to coeducation and serves as a case study of how coeducation for women students did not result in equal opportunities.</p>","She Was Treated For Some Time As A Dangerous Person: Ellen Swallow Richards And Coeducation At Massachusetts Institute Of Technology"

While <i>Playboy </i>had been in circulation since 1953, <i>Hustler </i>and <i>Playgirl </i>began publishing during the early 1970s. While attention is most often placed on the images, the advice columns in these magazines offered a much-needed public forum to discuss matters often kept private. Examining the advice columns across publications during this era helps shed light on matters of deep concern to readers. In <i>Playgirl</i>, female-identifying readers used the space between centerfolds to discuss matters of domestic violence, workplace discrimination, equality, gender roles, sexual health, abortion, religion, politics and empowerment. In contrast, in an era before the Internet, advice seekers in <i>Playboy </i>asked for clarification of the names of high-end cars, where the greatest gold reserves were, and how to navigate social relationships in upper class settings. <i>Hustler </i>provided a place for both men and women to write in, often about sexual health concerns. Those who were experimenting with BSDM, thought they might be bisexual, or were interested in other non-traditional male and female sexual relations also wrote to <i>Hustler </i>and were typically warmly greeted.This presentation will contextualize the different eras and intended audiences for each of the magazines. It will showcase the different styles, needs and responses that writers received to their questions posed to pornography-based magazines. These columns shed a unique light on the deep inequalities within U.S. society, most obviously based on gender and sexuality, but also of class, and occasionally race. It finds that some advice columns were often a comforting, rather than a wholly standardizing space, while others offered a very rigid, stifling portrait of gender and class roles, particularly around definitions of masculinity.</p>","Should I Be Concerned?: Gender, Class And Pornography Advice Columns In The 1970s"

In what remained an otherwise segregated city, the Dudley neighborhood held remarkable racial, ethnic, and language diversity and, like so many in Boston and around the country, bore the physical marks of decades of divestment, abandonment and deindustrialization. By the 1980s, nearly one-third of the land stood vacant, becoming frequent targets for illegal trash dumping and arson by absentee landlords. As the local nonprofit fought for and won the right to redevelop the neighborhoods economic, physical, and social landscape, it followed a rather predictable path that featured new affordable housing, youth development programs, and business incubation. It did so, however, through a series of experimental public and philanthropic funding programs that structured aid not only as grants but also as loans, tax credits, and subsidies. The Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative won awards and praise throughout the 1990s and seemingly provided evidence for the kinds of market-oriented policies and public-private partnership approaches championed by the New Democrats and the Clinton administration. Such claims of victory, however, reflected the assessments of politicians and philanthropists who used the newly constructed housing or active community centers as justification for retreat rather than for continued engagement in the activities that appeared to be working.</p>","Take A Stand, Own The Land: Public, Private, And Philanthropic Partners In The Dudley Triangle"

James A. Burke (D-MA), saw fit to quote a founding father: Thomas Jefferson, a famous farmer, knew the joys of working the land when he said, Cultivators of the Earth are the most valuable citizens. They are the most vigorous, the most independent, the most virtuous, and they are tied to their country and wedded to its liberty and interests by the most lasting bonds. Of course, Burke failed to mention that the lasting bonds to which Jefferson referred evoked cultivators—enslaved black people—whom he owned and who worked his land. This paper argues that Burkes emphasis on self-help through an agrarian ideal reflected an increasingly racialized and gendered dichotomy of deserving/undeserving poor in the context of deindustrialization. I examine the spatial politics of state-sponsored urban gardening programs in the postwar United States, specifically Detroits Farm-A-Lot program. I attend to the transformation of vacant space—lots under foreclosure that overwhelmed the Detroit area office of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)—through the reestablishment of a series of quantifiable, exchangeable units that Farm-A-Lot participants would keep green and tidy until the mayors office reclaimed them for development. In the 1970s and 1980s, U.S. policy makers increasingly delegitimized cash assistance programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children and the Food Stamps Program, demanding that black workers in places such as Detroit embrace their economic necessity—indeed find liberty—by forming lasting bonds with the soil. Farm-A-Lot served black Detroiters by doubling down on an institutional racism rooted—quite literally—in the history of slavery. This paper draws on sources such as the U.S. Department of Agricultures annual reports, memos from HUD, congressional hearings about gardening programs, and newspaper coverage of Detroits Farm-A-Lot program. I argue that the Food Stamp Act of 1977 and ideas of subsistence through self-help converged on the issue of land use in 1970s and 1980s Detroit. Historians of urban gardening in Detroit have suggested that struggles against capital flight were an economic response to deindustrialization while urban gardening was a cultural response. Such characterizations both reify the notion that labor and capital only meet in the workplace and assume that the economic and the cultural are readily separable. This paper is part of a larger project in which I argue that while studies of deindustrialization have tended to understand this period through spaces of production such as the plant and the union hall, approaching deindustrialization through spaces of reproduction such as the household, the community, and the welfare office can help historians to understand the post-1967 reconfiguration of the U.S. welfare state. I also ask whether the so-called crisis of care might be understood less as an event contained in the late twentieth century and more as a sustained and constitutive structure of capitalist accumulation. By invoking Jeffersons lasting bonds, commentators such as Burke revealed not only their cultural understandings of the postindustrial city but also political-economic immobilities that constrained social reproduction.</p>","The Most Lasting Bonds: Detroit's Farm-A-Lot Program And The Reconfiguration(S) Of Reproductive Labor Under Deindustrialization"

With fewer federal funds to hire workers to mow the grass and trim bushes in the citys public parks; provide rat eradication and winterization services; check for lead paint; and assist the elderly with chores they could no longer quite manage, the city abandoned or cut back severely on those and other antipoverty efforts. Meanwhile, the federal government tightened the eligibility requirements for entitlements, including Food Stamps and Medicaid. Despite the cuts, the citys children still needed safe places to play and live. Many elderly residents still needed support. And residents continued to need food and someone to care for them when they were sick. In the wake of the cuts, some simply did without. But women with low incomes, most of them African American, also stepped up to try to fill the voids. They monitored their childrens play; taped up garbage bags to keep out the vermin and cold; checked in on their elderly neighbors; traveled to distant food pantries; and stayed up late and missed work to monitor health scares. And they fought to restore needed funding. All the while, they were derided as welfare queens.

German director Richard Eichberg cast Wong in films that were co-produced in Germany, France, and England and subtitled or shot in multiple languages so that they could screen throughout Europe and, most crucially, the colonial world. Wong became a transnational symbol of racialized femininity and, through her star persona, a new pan-European cinema construed more broadly as global cinema could be created. The inequalities in gendered American racializations reflected in Hollywoods exploitative orientalist roles as well as the whole host of race-based laws that circumscribed Wongs life in California rendered this option appealing to her and prompted the emergence of new forms of relationality as well as new transnationally circulating forms of cultural production. Courtesy of her starring role, Wong and noted German Jewish philosopher Walter Benjamin (1892–1940) shared an unlikely encounter that set in relief European and American conceptions of modernity. Benjamins essay, juxtaposed against a cache of Wongs writings, are significant not just for what Benjamin says about Wong, or what Wong reveals, but for how they intervene in newly emergent constructions of racial and gendered difference. It is precisely the complex blend of Wongs American cosmopolitanism, Chinese heritage, and fashionable European sensibility, the seemingly contradictory aspects of which Benjamin stumbles over during the meeting, that are critical for Wongs cinematic success.</p>","(In) Equalities: Anna May Wong And Walter Benjamin, Berlin 1928"

In April it implemented the zero tolerance policy against the unlawful entry of family units seeking asylum, necessitating the companion procedure of family separation. Scuttled after six weeks due to public criticism, the bungled reunification process inflicted untold trauma and necessitated an obvious and punishing solution—increased family detention and incarceration of children. Only months later, a much-sensationalized migrant caravan of potential asylum seekers from Honduras received intense criticism from the White House. In between these events, the Trump administration again made efforts to expand family detention, designing rules that would evade court-ordered protections and make family detention and/or separation central enforcement strategies. The convulsive deployment of detention policy in 2018—restricted to executive orders, proclamations, and bureaucratic tinkering—was soaked in a brew of vitriol and racial anxiety that both justified the enforcement mayhem, and masked the deep roots of displacement abroad. The habitual use of family detention as a deterrence strategy reaches deep into the twentieth century, drawing from earlier administrations for legal rationales and infrastructure, and is the certain by-product of the Trump era of immigration enforcement. This presentation will explore the contemporary asylum crisis in the relation to previous crises, recurring strategies of family detention, and civic and communal provision of sanctuary. It will then examine how the reluctant response to refugees and asylum seekers dictates the parochial reliance on the detention regime.  </p>","(Whip)Lash Of Immigration Enforcement:  Family Detention, Separation, And Detention Again"

For their political activities, black teenagers met fierce repression, usually in the form of draconian disciplinary policies and the increased presence of police officers in public schools. Such policies shaped the criminalization of black youth activists and aided the rise of the punitive turn in public policy. Urban histories that have turned our attention to the role of federal policies and national actors in the making of the carceral state have created a path for new studies of the ways local communities, including the young people who were most affected by this process, experienced and responded to these developments. I argue that local histories of the punitive turn have the potential to reveal how political economies, racial geographies, and regional movement histories shaped the homegrown character of resistance to the carceral state—especially in public education. Using primary sources and secondary literature, I will make the case for more local histories of black teenagers responses to the punitive turn in public schooling. This paper examines Detroit, Los Angeles, and Mississippi, which, together, illuminate the role of black labor radicalism and multiracial coalitions in struggles against the overpolicing of schools, as well how black youth constructed alternative visions of public safety that sought to limit the powers of local law enforcement.</p>","A Case For Local Histories Of The High School Student Organizing Tradition And Its Responses To The Punitive Turn, 1968–1973"

Assuming that post-2014 new sanctuary movement formations in the United States directly extend from the 1980 sanctuary movement, this paper searches for more long-term precedents, considering two distinct historical moments: the implementation of the second Fugitive Slave Act in 1850 and the displaced persons crisis after World War II. In the 1850s black and white abolitionists in northern states such as Philadelphia, Massachusetts and Wisconsin contended with the depredations of the Fugitive Slave Act, as it created conditions of extreme vulnerability for African Americans, regardless of their birth or status. They attempted to change local laws and initiate practices of court accompaniment parallel to the ones used among contemporary sanctuary communities. Almost a hundred years later, during the high-water mark of human rights, advocates for European displaced persons looked to internationalist discourses to formulate the refugee policies currently being dismantled. The paper considers how the UN High Commission on Refugees Convention of 1951 both drew on and displaced prior internationalist formations.</p>","A Conjectural History Of Sanctuary"

With the Communist takeover of South Việt Nam and the end of the Việt Nam War on April 30, 1975, approximately 130,000 Vietnamese refugees fled Việt Nam and resettled in several host nations, including the United States. Eventually, thousands of Vietnamese refugees made a secondary migration after their initial place of resettlement. Most Vietnamese refugees resided in California but many resettled in Houston, Texas and there, they constructed a multi-nodal residential and commercial Vietnamese American community. By the mid-1980s, Vietnamese Houstonians established a vibrant business district, dubbed Little Sài Gòn. Unfortunately, toward the end of the 1990s, the Little Sài Gòn commercial district began to decline due to gentrification, rising cost of rent for tenants, a decrease in the number of consumers and city leaders attempt to revitalize the Midtown district. Consequently, Vietnamese Houstonians experienced a double home loss—first with the suffering from the loss of South Việt Nam, and secondly, gradually losing Little Sài Gòn. Despite enduring the inevitable loss of Midtowns Little Sài Gòn, Vietnamese Houstonians have constructed an exceptional, multi-nodal community that remains in flux. Thus, Vietnamese Houstonians are more inclined and equipped with sufficient political and social capital to further construct and preserve their new, de facto Little Sài Gòn in Southwest Houston. </p>","A Double Home Loss?

During the 1930s, San Bernardino developed into a significant site along Route 66 with Mexican merchants playing a central role in shaping how whites perceived Mexican food and culture. In particular, the Mitla Café, founded in 1937 by Lucía Rodríguez, developed into a landmark Mexican restaurant that catered not only to barrio residents but also to the local white population and white Route 66 motorists. During the highways heyday, the Mitla Café built a reputation as a go-to restaurant for many white motorists passing through the city, and women in the city utilized the famous highway to establish successful businesses and support community-building cultural initiatives. During the 1950s the Mitla Café once again served as an important site for Mexican and Mexican American culture when Glen Bell, founder of the fast-food restaurant Taco Bell, learned how to make hard-shell tacos after visiting the Mitla Café. The Mitla Cafés history reveals how Mexican women built community, ethnic identity, and performed cultural work that allowed for a formidable Mexican public presence during an era of segregation. Through analyzing how these women utilized food as a tool of cultural expression, resistance, and economic independence, we see how Mexican womens agency emerged to contest racial dynamics and shape our understanding of the past.</p>","A Fairyland Of Fine Mexican Food: The Mitla Café, Mexican Women, And Cultural Expression Along Route 66"

Missing from this portrait, however, is context: Silicon Valley grew up in America, which had already by the mid-twentieth century assembled the largest accumulation of wealth in history and become the worlds leading manufacturer. The worlds foremost military power, the U.S. government became a price-insensitive lead user for the valleys early telecommunications and electronics industries. In this paper, I will show that the valleys beginnings were far from humble.Its no coincidence that the valley began in California, a state born rich thanks to the gold rush, just south of San Francisco, Americas largest banking center west of the Mississippi. It began near universities (Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley) with top electrical engineering programs at a time when Americas research universities were becoming the envy of the world—universities funded by winners of the second industrial revolution.Given the resources and institutions required to develop a high-tech master cluster such as Silicon Valley, it was predictable that if such a region developed, it would appear in the United States, and that the Bay Area would be a leading candidate. The rise of Silicon Valley was not a rags-to-riches story. Instead, it was about the beneficiaries of previous industrial activity having an inside track to the next big thing.</p>","A Rich Inheritance: The Not-So-Humble Beginnings Of Silicon Valley"

While many foreign student advisers and university administrators assumed protective stances when students were threatened with loss of permission to work or with potential deportation, some were less sympathetic with foreign students who were deeply involved with protest (of U.S. or their home countries policies). Almost all university personnel found they had little impact on immigration policies regarding student status, which was more responsive to pressures from the State and Labor Departments. Indeed, many universities were less embodiments of positive freedom (of expression, of intellectual and cultural exchange, and activism) than of negative freedom (more like shields): refusing to divulge information about foreign students to government authorities and opposing the monitoring or targeting of students from particular countries. This paper draws on the records of the National Association of Foreign Student Advisors and material in the National Archives to discuss diverse university handling of foreign students at three historical moments: during the civil war in Nigeria in the late 1960s, the 1979–1981 Iran hostage crisis, and during an uptick of concern about Mexican illegal immigration in the early 1980s.</p>","A Sanctuary Or A Shield?

Stoller, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles, was one of many doctors affiliated with university-based gender clinics in the 1960s and 1970s. The clinics were concerned with attending to what was deemed to be, at the time, the problem of gender deviance. They saw patients, offered therapy, and sometimes even operated on individuals deemed to be true transsexuals. Their research culminated in the addition of gender identity disorder to the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> in 1980, along with the publication of the treatment protocols known as the Standards of Care. In 1957 Stoller walked into a Los Angeles County hospital to film interviews with psychiatric patients to use for medical students clinical evaluations. One of the patients he interviewed was a twenty-something-year-old woman with an already-thick medical and legal case file including check fraud, attempted suicide, homicidal thoughts, and paranoid schizophrenia. The relationship between Stoller and this woman, Mrs. G, would continue for the next fourteen years with Mrs. Gs clinical history providing the evidence for many of Stollers theories on female masculinity, female transsexualism, and gender identity. This paper explores the strange story of Mrs. G and her role in the development and trajectory of transgender therapeutics. Examining the places she appears in the Stoller Papers collection—bank ledgers, correspondence, publication drafts—I evaluate the role of an exemplary case in both clinical research and historical memory.</p>","A Very Strange Case Of Female Transsexualism: The University-Based Gender Clinics And The Crafting Of A Diagnosis, 1957–1980"

This paper explores some of the ways experimentation nonetheless left important legacies for colonial American communities and for the British Empires trading and manufacturing systems. The paper begins by considering conceptions of the silkworm and its relationship to Atlantic empire, linking the promotional literature considered in the first paper to the direction of development in the eighteenth century, as British demand and processing of silk increased substantially. It draws on primary sources from a series of American regions (from Florida to New England) in which official schemes to introduce silkworms were launched, arguing that one of the upshots of projection was to diversify populations, as silkworms and their travails unwittingly justified targeted recruitment of American settlers from Mediterranean locales<span style=&quot;font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:#0A0A0A;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA&quot;>–</span>including Greeks, Italians, French, and Spanish experts. Beyond the demographic and environmental legacies in North America, the paper argues that American production was more intimately connected to metropolitan debates in Britain about protectionism and trade than has heretofore been acknowledged. The prospect and then foreclosure of adequate raw silk production in the Atlantic world encouraged more systematic attention to silkworms product and its acquisition in Asia. Silkworms may never have been the transformative agents they were intended to be, but their peculiar needs and limitations nonetheless diversified the multicultural basis of labor in the New World and encouraged new kinds of imperial production in the Indian Ocean world.</p>","Accidental Agents Of Global Empire: Silkworms Impact On Eighteenth-Century British Colonialism"

Japanese women established Japanese branches of transnational feminist organizations in the late nineteenth century, and traveled across the Pacific to collaborate with colleagues in organizations advancing womens political rights, reproductive rights, peace and international cooperation, labor justice, and other types of feminist movements. These included, among others, the Woman&quot;s Christian Temperance Union, the Young Women&quot;s Christian Association, the Women&quot;s International League for Peace and Freedom, and the Pan-Pacific Womens Association. One of the key figures in womens political rights was Ichikawa Fusae (1893-1981), considered by the American occupation forces in Japan after World War II to be the Susan B. Anthony of Japan. I will focus on Ichikawas American linkages in this paper. Ichikawa, already a leading feminist in Japan, went to the United States for the first time after the passage of the 19th Amendment. While in the United States, she had meetings with Jane Addams, Cary Chapman Catt, and most important for her own intellectual trajectory, Alice Paul, whom she considered her major influence. She returned to the United States in the fall of 1928 to observe American women voting in the presidential election that year. US-Japan relations became attenuated in the 1930s, but Ichikawa worked hard to maintain contacts. Her experience with the US Occupation forces after 1945 was decidedly rocky, but she remade her bonds with leading American feminists after the war. Ichikawa was not the only Japanese suffragist inspired by the nineteenth amendment, but she was arguably the most notable.</p>","Across The Pacific: The Japanese-American Suffrage Nexus"

Second, this belief caused them to understand Christian identity as a condition for establishing gay subjectivity. Therefore, Howard University professor James Tinney and Reverend Troy Perry, founder of Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches, and other white gay and lesbian religious activists invoked the nations history of antiblack racism in order to render homophobia intelligible and to advance recognition of LGBT Americans within the beloved community. The paper argues that the gospel of gay liberation was predicated on the cultural intelligibility of antiblack violence, black religiosity, and the end of legal segregation. Further, attention to the role of religion in the LGBT social movement productively complicates scholarship on black and LGBT religiosity, which too often falls into well-worn debates over whether Christianity is conservative or liberal and whether the faith of black and/or gay Americans constitutes assimilation or resistance. In this paper, I first provide the context in which what I am calling the Affirming Christian Movement emerged. I then provide examples of the way Perry and Tinney invoked black suffering and religiosity in support of gay liberation. I conclude that these figures invite us to consider the value of queering scholarship on black, queer, and Christian identity in the post–civil rights era.</p>","Affirming Christianity: Race And Religion In The Gay Liberation Movement, 1968–1981"

In particular, the paper shows how black female litigants used the law to protect their interests in disputes with community organizations and neighbors and to structure relationships with the men in their lives. Black women also often frequently presented themselves in these suits as economically and legally savvy, and at times as operating more capably in the economic sphere than the men in their lives. At the same time, the paper examines the limits black women faced in using the civil courts against other African Americans, including the use of stereotypes and gendered arguments against them.</p>","African American Women's Civil Litigation In The Jim Crow South"

Roosevelts presidential victory on November 8, 1932, Alice Park penned a letter to her suffrage friend, Sylvia Pankhurst.  Park waited until after the election to respond to Pankhursts request for help to support Italian women under Benito Mussolinis regime.  Park told Pankhurst that she needed recovery time for the election phantasmagoria of that month. Squarely in Roosevelts camp, she was shaken by the attempt that was made to blow up Herbert Hoovers train in Palo Alto, her city. On November 16, she got back to work. After a limited number of women had been enfranchised in the United States, Great Britain, and elsewhere in the 1920s, Park, Pankhurst, and others had more to do.My argument traces how transnational suffrage networks challenged fascisms antifeminist policies after women had won the right to vote. While worldwide equal suffrage was still on their minds, women were also fighting hypernationalist policies that undermined equality and threatened to roll back progress. Many had been in Rome in 1923 for the International Suffrage Alliance meeting and were optimistic when Mussolini promised female enfranchisement. Could it be that the gradual path to womens equality, started in liberal democracies, was continuing under fascism?  By 1932, this hope was gone. Political leaders in the United States refused to engage.  Thus Pankhursts call on Park and other American women whose networks were strong, and whose votes were counted equally. Through archival research in the United States, England, and Italy, my work shows how womens networks continued after suffrage.</p>","After Suffrage: Transnational Feminist Networks For Equality"

The 1927 Buck v. Bell ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court gave Virginia the authority to sterilize its residents. In its wake state capitals across the union were inundated with similar prosterilization legislation. Compulsory sterilization rates climbed to record-breaking heights, and eugenics was widely accepted as a scientific theory among progressive policy makers, as well as a large portion of the general public. By 1935 eighteen states had passed eugenics laws, and roughly twenty thousand people had been forcibly sterilized due to a mental illness or criminal conviction. The American South was the most hesitant to adopt eugenic policies. Many people felt them to be in direct contradiction with southern values that emphasize family and parental rights. The Catholic Church led the chief opposition to such laws, but it was quickly joined in fierce resistance by various sects of Baptists and Methodists. This paper seeks to contextualize southern resistance to the eugenics movement within depression-era Alabama, where attempts to pass eugenics legislation led to mass political mobilization from the states religious citizenry. In doing so, it attempts to provide new insights into how southerners understood progress and state power, as well as how they attempted to reconcile such notions with the traditional values that dominate southern culture.</p>","Alabama Values: The 1935 Dominick Sterilization Bill And Southern Resistance To Eugenics"

This garment included a shortened skirt and trousers, which proponents argued was both healthier than the long, burdensome skirts that fashionable women wore and symbolized womens equality to men. Although this garment never gained widespread support, American reformers continued to adopt it for health and as a symbol of equality for the rest of the nineteenth century. Ironically, however, the outfit that represented equality for middle-class white women also highlighted the inequalities within the movement. Reformers assumed that immigrant, working-class, and African American women would also be drawn to the practicality of the bloomer costumes design and were surprised when the garment was rejected. For these lower-class women and women of color fashion represented social mobility and not inequality. To abandon fashion for dress reform would have meant abandoning the opportunity to be considered a proper lady. Lower-class women were particularly unwilling to make this sacrifice for a reform movement that would give them no voice. This paper will explore these two reactions to the bloomer costume—the expectation among reformers that clothing modifications would benefit all women in the same way and the lower-class rejection of clothing that would limit social mobility—between the years 1851–1900 to analyze how the dress reform movement perpetuated inequalities. This research will contribute to a broader historical discussion on the role of nineteenth-century social reform in creating a white, middle-class narrative of womens history.</p>","All Women Are Not Created Equal: Inequality Within The Nineteenth-Century Dress Reform Movement"

The paper advances two interrelated arguments, each of which deals with the role of international engagement in the fate of the Protestant mainline. On the one hand, I contend that liberal Protestant global encounters in the mid-twentieth century nurtured capacious new spiritual sensibilities that heralded the emergence of a post-Protestant spiritual but not religious ethos. On the other hand, the growing internationalism of ecumenical Protestantism fostered a significant backlash marked most especially by the formation of the National Association of Evangelicals (1942), conceived as a direct institutional counterpoint to the FCC. I argue that the emergent neo-evangelicalism of this period was a fundamentally nationalist movement born in opposition to the growing internationalism of the FCC and the dominant Protestant mainline. Too often American religious historiography matches the polarization of American religion itself, yet in this paper I aim to weave together accounts of conservative and liberal religious and political actors. My research examines these shifts through a detailed examination of the religious history of the United Nations, a microcosm of the large-scale religious dynamics of the age.

This paper approaches Yoshis killing and the subsequent gun-control movement it inspired as a microhistory for examining trends in American understandings of and approaches to guns and gun violence since the 1960s. Yoshis death demonstrates how American ideas, attitudes, and policies toward guns and gun violence have developed not in a vacuum but in transnational and international contexts. While Yoshis killing and the subsequent trial attracted national and international attention, it is the aftermath of both that offers historians an opportunity to consider the global impact of U.S. gun violence. After Yoshis death, his parents in Japan joined with his host parents in the United States—Holly Haymaker and Richard Haymaker, two professors at Louisiana State University—to start a gun-control movement. They organized letter-writing campaigns, protests, marches, and memorials. They built a transnational network aimed at not only changing laws in the United States but also shifting the way Americans thought about their relationships to guns. For this project I rely on the archival records of the Haymakers to reconstruct their efforts. Through their work the Haymakers discovered that what was most unique about American gun culture and politics was not found in its traditional mythologies but instead its entrenched refusal to learn from the rest of the worlds experiences.</p>","Americas Worst Disease: The Death Of Yoshi Hattori And The Movement Against Gun Violence"

So declared Senator William H. Seward in the 1855 speech that announced his embrace of the new Republican party. As historians such as Leonard Richards have shown, the objectively tiny number of American slaveholders—and the wildly unequal power they commanded in the national government—was a favorite theme of early Republican attacks on the Slave Oligarchy. For Horace Greeleys New-York Tribune, the true oligarchs were the 60,000 adult males who owned over ten slaves each: something closer to an antebellum 0.01 percent. Such tabulations papered over the ways slavery was far more deeply entrenched in southern society than men such as Seward or Greeley may have wanted to believe. But they served a key political purpose for northern audiences in the 1850s. Confronted with an increasingly aggressive proslavery state power, Republicans argued that only a mass rising of the People—against established laws, precedents, and institutions—could break the grip of the Slave Power. A crucial corollary to the slaveholding 1 percent was an antislavery ninety-nine percent. We are really the strong and they are the weak, said Frederick Douglass, comparing a few hundred thousand slaveholders to the 14 million people of the free states. This raw majoritarian populism distinguished the mass antislavery politics of the 1850s from the minority movements of previous decades, and it played a vital role in the emergence and ultimate triumph of the Republican party.</p>","An Antebellum One Percent: The Slave Power And Republican Party Populism In The 1850s"

Between 1929 and 1935, the United States removed roughly one-fifth of its Mexican-descent population. Countless families were torn apart. In many instances, U.S.-born children never saw or heard from their parents again. Mexican repatriation became one of the largest racial expulsions in U.S. history, second only to the American Indian campaigns of the 19th century.  Few groups protested the mass expulsion. Through the work of its border agent, Cleofás Calleros, the U.S. Catholic Churchs immigration office mounted the single most significant resistance to repatriation. During the early 1930s, at the height of Mexican repatriation, Calleros coordinated with members of the U.S. Catholic hierarchy, Mexican immigration officials, and civil rights organizations to blunt the effects of Mexican repatriation. Today, Catholic resistance to U.S. immigration practices that target Latinos for removal is widespread. My paper demonstrates how Mexican American civil rights leaders, including Calleros, first propelled Catholic resistance to coercive immigration practices. The historical actors at the heart of this paper are often absent in the historical record. By using immigration case files held by Catholic organizations, oral histories, and federal archival records, my paper further reveals a legal regime in the US-Mexico borderlands in which the U.S. Catholic Church emerged as a key player.</p>","Apostles In The Desert: How Mexican Americans Created Catholic Resistance To Repatriation And Deportation, 1929–1939"

Historians usually dismiss them as overblown, evidence of the hyperbolic and apocalyptic partisan rhetoric of the day. Even Federalists recognized monarchy had no place in the United States and suppressed urges to re-create it, we are told. Yet as this paper argues, when it came to education policy, the Federalists critics had a point. In the early republic, calls for widespread public education to create an informed citizenry were ubiquitous, if not clichéd. But it was Federalists who dominated education policy in this period, and they mostly built and supported academies. These privately run, state-chartered secondary schools primarily, and consciously so, served elites. Critics and reformers alleged that these schools did little to create a widely informed citizenry and that they preserved backward values; academies, in short, were monarchical. The critique of academies as monarchical turned on three points. Academies offered an outdated curriculum—focused on the classics and ornamental subject—designed for foppish European aristocrats and thus had no place in the United States. Academies were inaccessible, catering mostly to the wealthy. And finally, academies were privately run, which made them impervious to democratic control. This, critics alleged, was how education looked in monarchical societies. These criticisms were borne out in reality. In fact, I argue, Federalists valued and chose to support academies for the very reasons the schools were open to these attacks, even if they fought the monarchical epithet. Ultimately, the Federalists goal was not creating an informed citizenry, but rather a wealthy and culturally distinct elite, not unlike a European aristocracy. Academies were the means to that end.</p>","Aristocratic Education In The Early Republic"

These writings, as Brychan Carey has demonstrated, build rhetorically upon one another. However, the process of how these ideas were generated, discussed, and evolved within the meetings is poorly understood. This paper will explore the possible connection between this rhetorical evolution and the worship practices of Quakers in the 17th and early 18th centuries. Is it possible, in brief, that these ideas were generated as a direct result of the meeting practices? I will focus my investigation on how the interplay between 17th-century Quakers personal/empirical relationship with God, and their expectations of the public performance of that relationship within certain confines (testimony), created the tension within meetings that lead to occasional, yet regular, outbursts of moral ferment. In addition, due to the horizontally oriented structure of the meeting systems, Quakers were then compelled to digest these outbursts as metaphysically and epistemologically legitimate. It seems this process of digestion, though it involved a great degree of contestation between competing propositions, allowed these outbursts the space to evolve into fully formed ideologies.</p>","As Witnesses Of God: The Role Of Quaker Spiritual Epistemology In The Fermentation Of Antislavery Thought"

Particularly during the pivotal long 1970s, a groundswell of social movement activity transformed the war on sex offenders into a new and even more expansive phase by legalizing a category of good LGBT subjects while doubling down on many other bad ones. Even as LGBT activists managed to legalize a category of good gay sex between consenting adults in private, the architects of the war on sex offenders shifted gears by ramping up the criminalization of youth, sex involving HIV, trans and gender nonconforming people, and many other categories of bad queers. In making this argument, this paper extends key narratives in modern U.S. LGBT history, political and legal history, and nonhistorical queer theory. Whereas many LGBT historians have characterized the late twentieth century in terms of the consolidation of a legal hierarchy between homosexuality and heterosexuality, this presentation reframes that period as a time of the proliferation and hierarchal stratification of multiple categories of good and bad LGBT legal subjects. While from the perspective of good homosexuals, state interest in LGBT people tapered off and became weaker, from the perspective of bad queers the state regulation and criminalization of LGBT people became more intense, far reaching, and expansive. And while queer theorists such has Michael Warner have argued that the mainstream LGBT movement came to exclude bad queers from its political platform due to the sexual conservatism of movement leaders, this paper highlights the centrality of the rise of the child protection movement in the late 1970s to the movements retreat from a broader challenge to the criminalization of sexual deviance.</p>","Bad Queers: Lgbt People And The Carceral State In Modern America"

Suffragists designed this good woman icon to refute antisuffrage claims that the franchise would destroy the home, the relationship between the sexes, and the nation. Suffragists thus constructed the good woman—coded as white and middle class—to assuage fears about links between female enfranchisement and gender deviancy, sexual immorality, and race suicide. In defining themselves as true and good women, suffragists positioned themselves in opposition to bad women—a thinly veiled reference to prostitutes and black women—who purportedly lacked the womanly qualities of political morality and official honesty necessary to be reliable voters. At a time when imperialism and immigration threatened whiteness, many suffrage publications reassured the public that these minority women would not bother to cast a ballot, did not have enough power to sway elections, or would remain disfranchised. Thus, in the process of capitalizing on the cultural authority vested in gender norms, the mainstream movement reinforced class and racial hierarchies. As a result, suffragists sometimes supported—and even lauded—the disfranchisement of women who did not fit the model of respectable white womanhood that benefited their movement. This paper thus contributes to broader understandings about how women manipulate understandings of gender, race, class, and sexuality while engaging in politics.</p>","Bad Women Will Be Disenfranchised: How Suffragists Discussed Prostitutes And Black Women As Prospective Female Voters"

Americans who migrated to the island, located approximately 40 miles off mainland Cubas southwest coast, did not see themselves as expatriates but rather entrepreneurs and frontiersmen carrying the flag. Over more than two decades, they Americanized the isle by developing an export-oriented economy (primarily in citrus), creating schools, churches, and social clubs, and ushering in American goods, language, and currency. Pointedly, these settlers rejected local customs and maintained distance from native pineros, save for their utility as hired help. Considerations of race, class, and national identity all shaped the approaches of U.S. settlers, who saw themselves as distinctively and unquestionably American. In 1925 the U.S. Senate ratified the Hay-Quesada Treaty, a 21-year-old agreement between the U.S. and Cuban governments that affirmed Cubas sovereignty on the isle. By that point, the American community—which may have had as many as 2,000 residents by the mid-1910s—was in decline and most U.S. citizens returned north. By midcentury, a new influx of U.S. citizens arrived. They were enticed by the Cuban government looking to spur tourism. Some were looking for affordable winter homes. Others came to teach or missionize. Absent the zeal for annexation, U.S. citizens fraternized with their island neighbors, which included not only Cubans but other foreign nationals. By the time of the Cuban Revolution, which triggered the exodus of U.S. citizens from the isle, many Americans came to see themselves as pineros, too. While no one renounced U.S. citizenship, these Americans came to embrace a spirit of pinerismo that sharply contrasted with the diplomatic tensions between the two countries following the revolutions triumph.</p>","Becoming Pinero: How Americans Went From Colonizer To Neighbor On Cubas Isle Of Pines"

As black power activism emerged as an ideological, strategic, and tactical response to the limits of the civil rights movement, many black youth in Memphis embraced this ideology as a logical transition in the struggle for black freedom. At the same time that segments of black youth in the city began to turn toward this ideology, Memphiss Stax Records also began to shift its politics as it became less of the integrationist musical enterprise that it had been in the early 1960s. Stax embraced the ethos of black power both in its musical offerings and its economic pursuits. This paper traces this evolution, culminating in a discussion about the tragic death of Elton Hayes, a 17-year-old black male who was killed by the Memphis Police Department. In the aftermath of the tragic incident, the black community in the city exploded, and a riot ensued. The death of young Elton Hayes sparked violence and rioting in its aftermath and the youth and community at large responded. The Memphis chapter of the Black Panther party as well as other local black radical organizations attempted to rally the black community to action. Notably, Stax Records music recording artist Isaac Hayes, who by the late 1960s and early 1970s had become one of the leading soul icons in the music industry, was dispatched to help subdue the understandably distraught and frustrated black youth. This paper will also look to situate Isaac Hayess function during the riot, as well as Staxs position as the visible beacon of black power and black pride in Memphis and its impact on the city.</p>","Black Power, Black Youth, And Black Soul: Memphis, Stax Soul, And Black Youth Activism"

Colors provided one of the powerful ways that nineteenth-century Europeans and US Americans expressed political identities. In Europe during the 1848 revolutions, a distinction emerged between liberals fighting under various national tricolors and communists fighting under the monochrome red flag. The latter were the red republicans, distinct from (unmarked, normal, liberal) republicans. The emergent U.S. Republican party marked a similar distinction between those committed to the stars and stripes versus those referred to as Black Republicans, alluding to their alleged advocacy of equality between black people and white people. In the eyes of its enemies, black republicanism invoked a range of radicalisms resonant with European communism – equality between men and women, free love, equal distribution of property, etc. So-called black republicans generally did not scoff at the stars and stripes the way red Republicans might at the national liberal tricolor. (There is, however, a revealing exception: the formerly enslaved gunsmith James M. Jones, who repaired John Browns weapons in Canada, rejected Browns proposal to carry out his revolution under the U.S. flag, complaining that former slaves already had star and stripe markings on their backs in the form of scars from whipping.) European red republicans also formed an important component of the Republican party, as the term black Republican also suggested.</p>","Black Republicans, Red Republicans, And The Coming Of The Civil War"

This paper explores the history of this turning point and the role that queer truckers play in understanding and responding to it. I believe, based on my experience driving a semi and on oral histories I conducted of sixty-six drivers as research for my book Semi Queer, that truckers are increasingly hyperregulated and micromanaged because their jobs—the concrete tasks they do and see every day—teach them what the USA is and how it works, and our culture is very uncomfortable with working-class people (especially queer, trans, or black workers) having access to these secrets. Most Americans muddle along ignorant of where our food and other consumer goods originate and how they are produced. Further, living in our bubbles, we each do not witness the devastating poverty overtaking rural America and its accompanying racial and geographic divides. Truckers see it all. Truckings constant motion and the isolation of its workers are some of the jobs draw for queer and trans truckers. Once they start driving truck, they learn enough about how the world works that they need to be silenced, using surveillance, termination, or overwork. Companies can recruit new workers who are more vulnerable and have less training in resistance. The industry is committed to disciplining the kind of drivers who can combine their skills and tactics as sexual and racial minorities with the experience and education garnered while trucking.

Most scholarship on the effects of urban renewal on communities has focused on the issue of housing and the displacement of residents. However, I contend that black entrepreneurs experiences with urban renewal projects highlight the ways urban planners vision of modernity truncated the progress of Detroits black business community. Drawing on the records of city officials and community groups, newspapers, and oral histories, I argue that federally-funded municipal urban planning initiatives were used to support a system of economic white supremacy, and were essentially administered as state-sponsored wealth redistribution programs that benefited white business owners. Land seized through eminent domain was often sold to private developers at depressed prices, and public funds were used for the expansion of white-owned private enterprises. Furthermore, contracts for public urban renewal projects were awarded exclusively to white businesses. Because black entrepreneurs were not compensated equitably for property seized through eminent domain, and many could not afford to set up shop in a new location, numerous black businesses never reopened. The wealth accumulated by black business over the previous decades could not be passed on to subsequent generations—this constituted a major blow for black economic development in the city. My paper will contribute further insights on the persistent economic inequalities and disparities in wealth accumulation in urban American during the second half of the twentieth century.</p>","Black-Owned Businesses And The Inequalities Of Urban Renewal In Detroit, Michigan"

Shining a spotlight on urban underground nightlife during the early Cold War reveals subterranean nightspots in New York and San Francisco as social, cultural, and political hothouses that nurtured seeds of social consciousness. After World War II, as outspoken cultural producers ranging from the Beats, Michael Harrington, and James Baldwin to Mort Sahl, Charles Mingus, and Susan Sontag gravitated to Greenwich Village and San Franciscos North Beach, bars and nightclubs became important nodal points in postwar underground social networks. The result was a new sociopolitical sensibility that blended bebop jazzs embrace of free expression with progressive and expansive visions of American liberty.The origins of the underground 1950s style spanned from the <i>fin de siècle</i> cabarets of Paris and Berlin, through the left-wing Cultural Front of the depression era, and into the bebop sounds of Harlem, Beat literature, controversial brick wall stand-up comedy, and the socio-sexual aesthetics of camp. Small, smoky, bohemian bars and clubs offered not just entertainment but also progressive—even radical—political ideas that found new proponents, providing psychological and material support to the budding gay rights, feminist, civil rights movements. An exploration of night spots ranging from New Yorks Village Vanguard to San Franciscos Coffee Gallery and Tin Angel provides a deeper view of 1950s America, not simply as the black-and-white precursor to the Technicolor flamboyance of the sixties, but as a rich period of artistic expression and identity formation that blended cultural production and politics.</p>","Bop Apocalypse, Freedom Now!

In recent years, scholars have documented the vibrant history of this organization and how it emerged out of the leadership and political vision of women of color. However, less attention has been paid in this literature to the role of Puerto Ricans within these coalitions. This paper begins to trace the participation of Puerto Rican community organizers and clients of social welfare programs in the NWRO. It also considers the forms of political organizing for economic justice that Puerto Ricans took part in under the umbrella of this organization in a variety of northeastern cities. In doing so, the paper traces the relationships forged between Puerto Ricans and other groups within the broad multi-ethnic and multi-racial coalition forged within the welfare rights movement. It also draws on the records of the NRWO, community organizations, oral histories, and on ongoing archival projects in New York and New England documenting local Puerto Rican histories.

Nationwide, soaring enrollments stretched school capacity in big cities and small towns alike. But the problems were most acute in the new suburbs springing up along metropolitan fringes. The suburban building spree relied almost entirely on borrowed funds, because there was hardly any state aid, and no federal aid, available for school construction. To build new schools, districts had no other choice but to borrow in capital markets. For a number of complex reasons, interest rates for municipal bonds crept upward during the 1950s. The higher rates added unforeseen costs to school construction, which led to spiraling property tax rates, mounting frustrations, and near-perpetual tax revolts.This paper examines the efforts by New York State comptroller Arthur Levitt to manage the school bond crisis. At first, Levitt sought to stabilize interest rates by using the pension funds from state retirees to purchase outstanding school bonds. Then, he sought a more durable solution by proposing a new State School Financing Authority. However, both proposals failed: After an outcry from banking lobbyists, the state legislature rejected the School Finance Authority; and Levitt, under pressure to obtain higher returns for retirees, steadily shifted the pension funds into higher-yielding corporate stocks and bonds. Already during the height of the suburban boom, therefore, Americans found themselves dependent on financial markets for the most basic public good: the school buildings that educated their children. </p>","Borrowing To Build: The School Bond Crisis In Suburban New York"

This paper, however, argues that a pervasive American desire for unity existed and coexisted with, and even intensified in response to, the increasing reality of fracture. It takes as a case study Lee Greenwoods 1984 country/crossover hit God Bless the U.S.A., which has become practically the national anthem of the modern conservative movement—played at Republican presidential inaugurations, in the Gulf War and after 9/11, and as the official warm-up music at every Donald Trump rally. Despite Greenwoods own conservative bona fides, however, the singer has claimed he wrote the song not to promote conservatism but to bring people together. Drawing on Greenwoods two coauthored autobiographies, published interviews, and a textual analysis of lyrics and music videos, the paper situates Greenwoods body of work within two recent cultural trends that cut across ideological lines: the late twentieth-century canonization of World War II veterans as the greatest generation and the enduring popularity of a mythic agrarian past built on communitarian values. God Bless the U.S.A. suggests that the notion of an age of fracture may obscure a deeper conflict in late twentieth-century American culture between an authentic embrace of diversity among historically marginalized groups and a pervasive, yet frustrated, longing for unity and homogeneity among white men (and some white women) that transcended political and ideological boundaries.</p>","Bringing People Together: God Bless The U.S.a.

The belief that battle represents a space and an activity that is the exclusive province of men goes back centuries. That largely unexamined assumption is ever-present in American military history, sometimes implicit but very often explicit. There is simply no profession in America so thoroughly identified with maleness as soldiering, and battle—the defining activity of the soldier—is a space suffused with masculinity. Men make war, and war makes men. There is another set of equally pervasive, and similarly unexamined, assumptions about soldiers ability and willingness to fight. Scholars have frequently depicted combat motivation as inextricably tied to masculine identity: male honor, male shame, and the particular kind of male bonding in combat units termed social cohesion have been used at various points in the last half-century to explain the willingness of soldiers to face enemy fire. Of course, the belief that battle is solely the preserve of men does not hold up well against the empirical data in the historical record. Assumptions about combat as a purely masculine activity have increasingly come into question in the past quarter-century, a debate that took a sharp new turn in late 2015 when then–secretary of defense Ash Carter announced that the U.S. military would begin the process of opening all combat jobs to women. This paper explores the current state of the discourse surrounding women in combat roles, with special attention to the ways that different groups—military brass, civilian leaders and pundits, active-duty soldiers and officers, and combat veterans—have responded to, challenged, and shaped the debates about masculinity and masculine identity on the battlefield.</p>","Brothers In Arms?

While elements of the knowledge economy anchored in the areas universities were thriving, this activity had not helped the working-class neighborhoods hard hit by deindustrialization—many high-tech jobs moved toward the suburbs. For many, the emerging biotechnology sector offered a new industry where Massachusetts might play a catalyst role in the growth of new jobs. While the development of individual biotechnology companies has often been told from the perspective of scientific entrepreneurship or controversies concerning safety, it was also an industry enmeshed in extensive public-private discussion regarding economic development writ large among state agencies, municipal governments, real estate firms, universities, and industry organizations such as the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council. With reference to three efforts—the Cambridges Kendall Square Urban Renewal Project, the Worchester Biotechnology Park, and Bostons Charlestown Navy Yard bioprocess plant project—I explore the negotiations and tensions associated with efforts to attract biotechnology jobs to urban centers. While initial ground-clearing efforts for new enterprises were often successful, they struggled to address the underlying economic challenges that had given rise to these partnerships. Understanding the fate of these partnerships allows us to cast a more critical eye on current efforts to address the decline of urban employment through initiatives to attract an innovative creative class back to the urban center.</p>","Building Genetown: Biotechnology As An Remedy For Deindustrialization In Eastern Massachusetts"

When they had arrived in the United States fewer than two decades earlier, they brought more with them than their famous tulips and sturdy wooden shoes. They also carried a vision of global religious and political imperialism that shaped the international posturing of Dutch immigrant communities throughout the Midwest. Even amid the tumult of the Civil War, these communities remained hopeful that after the conflict they would be poised to continue to develop their own standing in the United States and throughout the world. The ship they blessed in June of 1864 was to play a crucial role in that vision. Due to financial and leadership crises, the ship never materialized; nevertheless, the global aims of these communities persisted. The collection of Dutch colonies throughout the Midwest continued draw on the intellectual and religious traditions they brought with them from Europe to pursue their global vision. This paper examines how these rural immigrant communities understood their engagement with imperialism and the efforts they took to participate in religious, economic, and political imperial expansion by both the U.S. and the Dutch Empires in the nineteenth century. It emphasizes how international networks formed by doctors, missionaries, and professors living in all corners of the global Dutch Empire and throughout the United States constructed a particular imperial vision. This vision, furthermore, relied on religious imperatives to evangelize to justify a broad imperialistic agenda. In this way, intellectual networks and religious justifications undergirded an international imperial program.</p>","Building Our Empire At Home And Abroad: The Global Imperialism Of Nineteenth-Century Immigrants To The Midwest"

These ministers were, what I call, Bureau Clergymen as they helped the FBI maintain prevailing inequitable social arrangements. The FBI anointed these ministers as Special Service Contacts and/or placed them on the bureaus Special Correspondents Lists. Far from secret informants, ministers in these official bureau programs enjoyed very public and cooperative relationships with the FBI and were occasionally called into service to work in concert with the J. Edgar Hoovers Bureau. The paper displays how the FBI called upon such ministers to utilize their 1) status, 2) popular media ministry, and 3) Cold War spirituality to publicly discredit the civil rights movement, painting it not as a religious crusade, but rather as a communist take-over. The story moves the scholarship on the FBI beyond the well-known narratives of the bureaus hostility toward and surveillance of religion and religious adherents, and it reveals how the bureau institutionally embraced a form of white Protestant Christianity and leveraged it into working relationships with black and white Protestant ministers. It also offers a window into the overlooked religious dimensions of the FBIs opposition to the civil rights movement even as it highlights how black clergy articulated and followed competing ideologies of black liberation.</p>","Bureau Clergymen"

As stellar record keepers and preservers of family history, women in the del Valle family made concerted efforts to preserve their family history and narrate a story of Californias past at critical historical moments when the political and social significance of Spanish Mexican families was under threat (1860–1910). The del Valle women at times appropriated and countered the romantic images and popular memories of California often boosted by white Americans. I argue that they sought forums and narratives that clearly staked out their authority in claiming a California past. By looking closely at practices such as archive building, cultural performances, and preservation efforts, my research reveals how women navigated the shifting geopolitical and cultural borders through the strategic use of legacies.</p>","Californiana Legacies: Navigating Family And Popular Memories In Californias Borderlands"

Hundreds of young adults, together with their parents and guardians, applied. They sent petitions to their state legislatures describing their experiences, desire for learning, financial limitations, hearing and visual incapacities, and, ultimately, their deservingness of support. This paper draws on approximately three hundred of these petitions in Massachusetts and New York (dating from 1819 to 1850) as well as extensive state-level administrative records and correspondence between state officials, applicants, and school directors. These materials reveal that state and school administrators carefully selected applicants for scholarships based on their perceptions of their capacity for citizenship. Despite legislation specifying that candidates would be chosen randomly, or by lot, bureaucrats selected young adults who they believed might effectively remedy their disability and poverty by becoming laboring, economically self-sufficient citizens following graduation. Young adults, meanwhile, actively negotiated their cases, mobilizing their own claims to citizenship. Some argued that they deserved support based on their residency, patriotism, or academic aptitude. The determination and creativity that these young adults showed in contesting their cases ultimately forced administrators to clarify the meanings of disability, capacity, and labor in their selection processes. The requirement, adopted by many states in the early 1830s, that candidates submit medical evaluations as part of their petitions was just one of many new policies intended to identity and distinguish these deserving students. </p>","Capacity For Education:  Disability, Schools, And State Support In The Early Republic"

In 1944 Eric Williams published Capitalism and Slavery, aiming to analytically tease out the structural relationship between capitalism and slavery, and how the latter was a precondition for the emergence of the former. Even today there is still a tendency among many historians to caricature his arguments and insist that the Williams thesis, which many claim to discredit, can be reduced to his argument concerning the causes of abolition. Regardless, as Greg Grandin himself has insisted, each generation seems condemned to have to prove the obvious anew: Slavery created the modern world. This seems to be a growing consensus: New histories of capitalism—award winning publications—and the various centers for the study of capitalism across the United States attest to the enduring strength of Williamss argument. Yet, the task at hand is to engender these histories, to find the structural relationship between capitalism, slavery, and patriarchy. In this paper, I argue that the new histories of capitalism should be brought into conversation with Marxist feminist texts that emerged in the 1970s. Furthermore, these should be supplemented with gender histories of slavery. These texts have all challenged the assumption held by many scholars to pay more attention to the evolution of the means and forces of production than to the process of reproduction. Looking at regimes of reproduction over the longue durée, with a particular focus on how black women were expected not only to reproduce a future slave force but often also to reproduce their future overlords, tells us a different story about how capitalism came to emerge. It opens up the avenue to racialize histories of patriarchy and engender histories of slavery. By doing both, and centering black women, it helps us more accurately uncover the human story.</p>","Capitalism, Slavery, And Patriarchy"

Native peoples and English colonists took and circulated captive bodies to alternately resist and assert sovereignty and geopolitical hegemony. The gendered nature of captive bodies—and the labor (domestic, agricultural, and procreative) they could perform—were central to these struggles. This paper explores the gendered nature of Indian enslavement and captivity—and the politics of reproduction—used to structure power in the northeastern borderlands. During the Pequot and King Philips War, English colonists enslaved indigenous men, women, and children. This paper will focus on captive indigenous women and children in particular, and the ways that English colonists attempted to gain exclusive access to captive female bodies and labor while denying similar access to their native allies. English-allied sachems from the Narragansett and Mohegan, during the Pequot War, and the Mohegan and Pequot during King Philips War, desired female captives to shore up lineages devastated by war while securing the future of their peoples. Each group viewed captive women and children as valuable human capital who provided valuable labor, but captivity had other consequences. As English colonists and their shifting array of Native allies consolidated their authority over captive women and children by removing them from their kin and communities, the presence of bodies among captor societies created a simultaneous absence that undermined indigenous survivance. This paper argues that this dialectic of presence and absence empowered certain English and native polities at the expense of others, dramatically reshaping the geopolitical landscape in southern New England. While unplanting and replanting were absolutely part of the equation, careful consideration of the experiences of captive women and children forefronts the centrality of gendered violence and co-optation of gendered labor to the deracination of native peoples. Native polities and English colonists all engaged in a politics of reproduction, looking at captive peoples as a source of power and labor to be acquired and exploited to resist or advance settler colonialism. Power thus hinged upon the circulation and co-optation of captive bodies whose reproductive labor (both social and procreative) could be used to capitalize colonization or shore up indigenous polities struggling to retain sovereignty.</p>","Captivity, Gender, And The Politics Of Reproduction In Seventeenth-Century New England"

This paper showcases how the federal government utilized women and the gendered imagery of their aid work to balance its role as global police with its claims to the American public that the United States was not overly embroiled in empire or world affairs. Women played key roles in federal agencies, United Nations (UN) appointments, and voluntary agencies, as liaisons, organizers, and caregivers. The work that women did on this aid front was gendered, as were its targets—propaganda and press coverage on aid to Korea relied heavily on imagery and language about starving children, widowed women, and disabled men. By utilizing women and their gendered work, I argue, the United States framed its position in Korea as one that was unofficial, not overly committed, and a function of individuals (not the states) prerogative: women made empire in Korea palatable to the American public. Throughout the 1950s, Korea served as a proving ground for modes of American influence in foreign countries. The federal government utilized the cooperation of the UN and voluntary organizations to test strategies for military, financial, and cultural control in Korea—strategies that would form the basis for American empire in the context of limited war around the globe in the rest of the twentieth century. This paper highlights that the Korean War and its aftermath are vitally important to understanding how American empire played out in a post–World War II world.</p>","Caring For Empire: Aid To Korea In The 1950s And The Engendering Of American Hegemony"

I analyze the census to build a demographic profile of Mexican American educators prior to World War II in south Texas.  Historians do not know exactly how many Mexican Americans worked in this profession in any period or region in U.S. history. Only one scholar, historian Vicki L. Ruiz has suggested that Mexican-origin women may have figured prominently in national assessments of professional/technical employees, where Mexican-origin women made up 2.9 percent of white collar workers in 1930. Within this slim margin, this study asks adonde están las maestras? Where are the Mexican American teachers? What can they tell us about their professional journeys in light of the dilemmas they may have confronted in Juan/Jaime/Jim Crow America?  Did Mexican American women, like their Euro-American and African-American colleagues, perceive teaching as a viable option toward middle-class achievement and professionalization in the pre-<i>Brown </i>era?  How do their personal educational and professional successes square with the larger undereducated, underemployed status of Mexican-origin people?  The answers hint at the role, place, and historical significance of teachers within Mexican American communities.  Ideally, this study strives to explain when and why Mexican American teachers emerged as an identifiable class of workers and how their employment may have shaped the educational pathways of Mexican-heritage populations.</p>","Census Breakthroughs In The 1930 Portraiture Of Mexican American Teachers"

Building on the integral research of scholars who have centered Mexicanas, Mexican American women, and Chicanas as workers, cultural producers, political organizers, activists, and intellectuals, my work calls attention to the dignity work and militant dignity politics of poor Chicanas in Los Angeles. My presentation will briefly focus on Escalantes political biography of gender and leadership that traces the dignity work that she and many others undertook to advocate for the human dignity of poor women locally and nationally. This dignity work centered the basic human needs of poor people and took many forms including direct action tactics such as demonstrations, pickets, marches, vigils, and disrupting the day to day business of welfare offices and county administrators, among other state officials. Dignity work also included the difficult task of building and sustaining political coalitions across racial, gender, and class lines. Doing this dignity work and more necessitated the practice of a militant dignity politics. Escalantes dignity politics were militant because of the constant threat and attack on the livelihood of welfare recipients that she and countless other poor mothers and families faced at the hands of the welfare system, federal and state policy, and the need to fight against ideological and institutional injustices. The militant dignity politics practiced by Escalante included, as well, being a staunch advocate of the human dignity of poor people, building bridges across difference, and forging political solidarity with the multiple movements that advocated for the recognition of the human dignity of those on the margins of society.</p>","Chicana Militant Dignity Politics: Building Coalitions And Political Solidarity In The Los Angeles Welfare Rights Movement"

Jesse Jacksons two bids for the Democratic partys presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988. It looks at how one organization known as the League of Revolutionary Struggle, which formed in 1978, organized around Jacksons organization known as the Rainbow Coalition. A primarily Chicana/o group known as the August 29th Movement (1974–1978) merged with I Wor Kuen (IWK) and the Revolutionary Communist League (RCL) to create the new multiracial communist party often known as the League, or Liga in Chicana/o movement circles. The League participated in a variety of struggles related to Chicana/os, but they were also involved with Asian Americans who made up IWK and African Americans who made up the RCL. One of the benefits of having a multiracial organization was that they organized in a host of different communities nationwide from 1978–1990, when the organization existed. They participated in things such as labor and college campus struggles. However, Jacksons political campaigns are a site for examination because they brought together different avenues of the Leagues activism. This paper will explore how a communist organization that followed a Leninist idea of a vanguard party still sought to participate in electoral politics. I ask why it was that they felt Jacksons campaign was the one to support in two different political cycles? Through oral histories and primary sources, I will show how Chicano and Chicana communists held positions of power in Jacksons campaign. I will also reveal how the League was able to bring Jackson to many of the struggles they were leading, such as the Watsonville Cannery Strike in the 1980s, the fight to keep General Motors in Van Nuys open, and for a movement for equal educational rights in California that brought together students of color from colleges and universities at all levels. Jackson attended these three key movement events and benefitted from the League writing his speeches while the League also gained legitimacy in democratic circles for the way they were able to push Jacksons position on labor. Thus, I seek to examine how Chicana/o communists played a role in electoral politics in the 1980s by weaving togther how they created a united front approach that connected labor, student struggles, and electoral politics.</p>","Chicana/O Communists And Jesse Jacksons Presidential Campaigns And The Rainbow Coalition, 1983–1988"

In histories of agricultural science this is particularly challenging, in part because the objects of agricultural science—animals and plants and farm landscapes—are mostly known popularly through early childhood education. Contemporary audiences have been formally taught how to imitate a chicken or a cow but not much else. Modern lack of familiarity with agriculture means that many productive features fundamental to agriculture, like managed sexuality, slaughter, feeding and intentional fatness, dirt and manure feel transgressive and more than a little disgusting. Historians of agricultural science are used to anticipating and deflecting this laughter, by concealing these features. This paper describes the distorting consequences of our attempts at seriousness, which force us to blur details of bodily experience that were, for much of American history, an accepted part of everyday life. It argues that by embracing and highlighting the grotesqueries at the core of agricultural production, the very features that make audiences laugh, we can find the agricultural sciences most significant connections to the history of the body and of race and gender, as well as their important ecological consequences.</p>","Chicken Is A Funny Word: The Distortions Of Seriousness In Histories Of Agricultural Knowledge"

Although narratives of the disaster have been told time and again, the fires aftermath demonstrates previously overlooked tensions between city and state, between state authority and Federal intervention, and between a Civil War past and a Reconstruction present. Surprisingly, disaster relief was rather quickly organized and from a completely unexpected source. Acting unilaterally, Civil War general Philip Sheridan, a Chicago resident and then in command of a significant portion of the nations peacetime army, summoned the power of the Federal government, arranging for the transportation of shelters and food for thousands dispossessed by fire. Later more Civil War figures became involved—including General-in-Chief William T. Sherman and former general Ulysses S. Grant, president of the United States. This unprecedented government-sponsored support had an unforeseen result.  John Palmer, fifteenth governor of the Illinois and once a Union major-general, began a very public political war, first with Chicagos Mayor Roswell B. Mason and eventually the generals he had known and served under during the war. At root was the larger background of Reconstruction.  Between May 1870 and April 1871, Congress, shoring up protections for African American civil rights, passed the Enforcement Acts authorizing, in part, Federal supervision of elections and the prosecution of a states citizens.  Thus, the collision between state and Federal authority renewed issues many thought settled in the recent war, now reignited by Chicagos fire.   </p>","Civil War Memory And The Great Chicago Fire"

This institution building shaped the direction of black British radicalism and, ultimately, the development of the British Left in the 1960s and 1970s, introducing a much increased consciousness of race and racism in the United Kingdom to the New Left and cultural studies as well as to such Old Left groups as the Communist party of Great Britain and its journal <i>Marxism Today</i>.

The saga of Latinos re-shaping—and often revitalizing—religious life plays out all over the United States. But this growth has occurred in decades of contracting resources. I wrote a book about the making of Mexican parishes in Chicago precisely in an era marked by their closing. With fewer clergy, aging buildings, decreasing church membership, and archdiocesan budget problems, parish closed in several waves across the city since 1990. In the Pilsen neighborhood, with its pioneering and rich tradition of Mexican Catholic life, the mosaic of parishes has greatly diminished. In the 1970s Pilsen had twelve parishes; just three parishes remain today. I witnessed painful crises as Mexican parishes struggled to keep the doors open and to anchor community, ethnic identity, and spiritual lives.Many informants view the closing of their local church as another outcome of systemic inequality that Latina/o people experience in Chicago and across the United States. They often blame the church hierarchy (which includes few Latino clergy among the decision makers) for failing to care for the interests of Latinos. People in Pilsen also view the string of parish closings as a symptom of gentrification or the whitening of their barrio.

They existed in every British colony outside of those in New England. The courts had the absolute jurisdiction to try, convict, and execute and were manned by two to three justices of the peace and a group of elite planters varying in number from three to six. There was never a jury of enslaved Africans and no right of appeal. Once an enslaved person was convicted, court magistrates examined and evaluated her or him, estimating a price against the going rate for an enslaved man in the Atlantic market. Authorities drew the money for compensation from a fund created through taxes and fines paid by poor whites for trading with, sleeping with, or entertaining enslaved persons. Using newly discovered records, my paper examines the functioning of two slave courts, in Pennsylvania and Maryland, during the eighteenth century and the compensation payments paid to owners of executed slaves. I argue these courts became a crucial component of white, elite hegemony by allowing slave owners to utilize state power as a form of discipline and appear self-effacing and judicious while preserving their property claims. My hypothesis is that slave courts became a fundamental component in the constitution of a Black race by creating disparities in conviction rates, enslaved-specific punishments, and funneling Africans out of the primary judicial structures within the colonies.</p>","Compensating Whiteness: Slave Courts In Colonial British North America"

The United States initiated this trend when it began testing weapons offshore in the Marshall Islands where, between 1946 and 1958, it detonated 67 of its largest nuclear bombs. As historians of science and technology have begun to explore, American researchers engaged not only in weapons research but also in biomedical, environmental, and anthropological inquiry facilitated by these destructive tests. Equally as important to nuclear testing, however, were U.S. legal experiments with new territorial forms in Oceania. This paper traces how nuclear weapons testing in the Marshall Islands entangled with the United States creation and maintenance of a sui generis territorial entity—a United Nations (UN) strategic trusteeship over which the United States exercised near-exclusive control. Drawing on archival research in U.S. military, Atomic Energy Commission, Department of State, and Department of Interior records, the paper demonstrates how the creation and maintenance of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands both grew out of and justified experiments with nuclear armaments. Simultaneously, it explores how this novel, international territorial status strictly limited the legal rights of islanders and their allies to object to the appropriation and use of indigenous lands, waters, communities, and bodies for scientific experimentation. As fallout from nuclear tests ranged worldwide, the United States territorial experiment contained indigenous discontent offshore.</p>","Crafting A Nuclear Empire: The Making Of The U.S. Pacific Proving Grounds"

But how did Americans come to know and construct the tropics as a discrete and distinctive environmental space, and as an imperial problem to be solved? To the extent that historians have tried to answer that question, they have tended to rely on a handful of high cultural sources, assuming that they both influenced and reflected popular understanding. In this paper, I argue that the isthmian transit period – the two decades between the discovery of gold in California in 1848 and the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, when approximately 800,000 people crossed the isthmus of Panama to travel between the East Coast of North America and the new U.S. territory of California—provides a remarkable opportunity to write a social history of American perceptions of, and ideas about, the tropics and tropical nature. By utilizing a source set of more than one hundred diaries, collections of correspondence, books, and other publications, I will assess this unique transit period as one in which travelers shaped each others expectations of and interactions with the tropical nature and peoples, mixing empirical observation with preconditioned expectations to create a discourse on the tropics and its most potent symbols.</p>","Crossing At Panama: Patterns Of Tropical Perception During The Isthmian Transit Period"

Its basic political economy—small firms, intense competition, extensive subcontracting, low cost of entry, and a labor-intensive work process—made it a haven for entrepreneurs from the margins, especially immigrants. Another type of marginal entrepreneur that flooded into the garment business was the gangster. Organized crime was a perennial and troublesome presence in the industry from its emergence at the turn of the twentieth century until its collapse and departure during the 1960s and 1970s.We should not understand organized crime as somehow peripheral to the garment industry. Nor should we draw a bright line between gangsters and so-called legitimate manufacturers. Gangsters played key and legible roles in the trade—as manufacturers, truckers, middlemen, and sometimes all three. Coercion was a basic feature of garment work—whether the explicit, forceful coercion of the gangster or the calculated search for a desperate work force mounted by the ordinary manufacturer. The main difference between the gangsters and the legitimate manufacturers was gangsters willingness to make literal the adjective most often used to describe the trade—cut-throat. But the difference was one of degree, not of kind. This paper will explore the role of organized crime in in garment industry, including its role in helping collapse the New Deal settlement, a twenty-five-year détente between the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and the legitimate manufacturers.</p>","Cut-Throat: Chiselers, Racketeers, And The Collapse Of The Northeastern Garment Industry"

This paper will specifically focus on Dakota cradleboards to better understand the importance of cradleboards as historical artifact. In the Dakota context, cradleboards change over a period of time after contact with non-Dakota peoples and the introduction of various textiles and beads. How did Dakota women indigenize and incorporate these foreign textiles and beads into their cradleboards? Why did the use of cradleboards slowly disappear? And why are Dakota cradleboards currently being reclaimed, used and revitalized within tribal communities and members?

But the publication of John Wesley Powells official report, <i>Exploration of the Colorado River of the West and Its Tributaries</i> (1875)—and especially the popular account by crew-member Frederick S. Dellenbaugh, <i>A Canyon Voyage</i> (1908)—revealed and defined the American Southwest as a region where people could find adventure, test their mettle, and discover freedom. These men did not produce monotonous logs of quotidian experiences and observations; they structured stories that pitted the landscape as a formidable opponent in a heroic struggle for survival, and they cast themselves as frontier conquerers. In this endeavor, they drew on the structure of earlier narratives by explorers and geologists, and in turn, their stories fired the imagination of scores of adventurers, scientists, engineers, and tourists, who launched their own expeditions down the Colorado River. Before embarking, adventurers rehearsed their trips by reading Powell, Dellenbaugh, and others, whose dramatic narratives framed and structured their own experiences of what one adventurer called the worlds most dangerous river. Drawing on the journals and stories written by more than 150 men and women who boated these rivers between 1869 and 1977, this paper explores how adventure narratives shaped the ways subsequent adventurers experienced the river and imagined themselves as pioneers in a landscape they claimed as their own.</p>","Danger River: Narrating Adventure Through The Southwestern Canyonlands"

Oblinger, an over-mortgaged homesteader in northern Nebraska, lamented the unfreedom of indebtedness in a letter to a relative in Ohio. While my accounts remain unsettled, he wrote in explanation of his inability to travel east for a visit, my time is not my own. Fifty years later, in <i>Bankruptcy in United States History</i> (1935), the legal historian Charles Warren noted the striking fact that whenever there has been any serious economic or financial upheaval in this country, the States have enacted stay-laws prolonging the period when a debtors property should be exempt from execution. Between these two observations—Oblingers expressive narration and Warrens scholarly assessment—lies a neglected political history of financial time in nineteenth-century America. This paper surveys the many ways that Americans experienced financial time in this era and used the law to force the credit economy to follow the steady beat of moral expectations, in stay measures as well as redemption, appraisal, and scaling laws. It argues that these devices regarded time as a legal construct that could be manipulated to limit the logic of commodity formation- and capital formation. Further, it recovers the political struggles these measures aroused, in arcane battles over procedural reform and more visible disputes before the Supreme Court. The paper suggests that the emergence of predictive economics in the early twentieth century represented more than a cultural accommodation to financial modernity. It also satisfied a set of moral needs and wants, in contradictory ways, that had once been the preserve of popular politics and the law.</p>","Debt And The Politics Of Time"

Keckley was born enslaved in Virginia and suffered the terrors inherent in the system before purchasing her freedom. Less well-known is that Keckley borrowed the money with which she broke the chains of slavery. Historians of the post–Civil War period have shown evidence for the exploitive nature of lending and the simultaneity of the importance of access to credit for African Americans after emancipation. This paper relies on slave narratives to show that these issues did not begin in the modern banking era. Credit was often fundamental to gaining freedom for those who were enslaved. For free people credit was a buffer against the threat of re-enslavement and the indignities of white supremacy. But the use of credit also made African Americans vulnerable to further exploitation. This research describes credit arrangements for African Americans asserting freedom in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before the rise of savings banks and lines of credit. Loans were between individuals with a pre-existing relationship and took several standard forms. Sometimes these credit arrangements resulted in draining precious little resources from an already-exploited population. Other times borrowers, such as Elizabeth Keckley, were able to take advantage of debt to get a toehold on freedom.</p>","Debt And The Promise Of Freedom: Evidence From Slave Narratives On Credit Arrangements Before Modern Banks"

Work, Race, And Ability In The History Of U.S. Capitalism Around 1900</h5></p><p>This presentation scrutinizes the practice of sharecropping as a pivot in reorganizing racist hierarchies through debts politics in a postslavery economy after 1865. It analyzes the regimes of responsibilization prevalent in forcing black people to exploit their own labor while being excluded from opportunities to capitalize on it. After the end of the Civil War, freedom was supposed to open up possibilities for black people in the South to engage in wage labor or, at first glance, to gain even more independence by becoming sharecroppers. However, rather than providing the chance to build up property of ones own, allegedly self-determined conditions brought an inflation of risks for families that culminated in structural debts, accompanied by a powerful discourse of inability. Jim Crow shaped an economy wherein black bodies again became mapped as the least efficient, not capable of self-management, and often even dangerous. In fact, the interrelation of a criminalizing justice system, debts ties, and risky work conditions demarcated black bodies as exploitable terrain for expropriation. What complicates any historiographical research of this issue is the silence of debtors in many written sources. Thus, this talk will use oral histories to scrutinize economic proprietorship strategies. It aims at widening the narrow focus on the binary of economic suppression, on the one hand, and successful participation stories, on the other. Instead, property politics in everyday life stories of work will be contextualized as engravings onto debtors bodies that materialized intersectional relations of race, class, gender, and ability.</p>","Debtors Bodies: Sharecropping And Proprietorship At The End Of The Nineteenth Century In The South"

The letter both intensified an ongoing conversation about homosexuality in the National Council of Churches and started a decade-long conversation with the fellowship that ended in deep disappointment on both sides. By the end of that conversation in 1992, the council not only decided to postpone indefinitely its decision on the fellowships formal membership it also denied them informal observer status and even abolished observer status itself in wake of the controversy. Recent scholarly work on the National Council of Churches has focused on the mid-20th century, when the organization was at the height of its sociocultural influence and its decline only visible at the horizon. This paper examines a critical case from the 1980s and 1990s, the period of overt decline, to understand internal and external forces that contributed to it. Using archival sources, media sources and interview data, it explores the two most significant moments in these debates: the 1983 controversy over membership status and the 1992 controversy over observer status. This analysis will attend to factors internal to the parties (institutional versus lived ecumenism; public identification as gay or lesbian) as well as larger social factors (the rise of evangelicalism and AIDS) that shaped the shift in tone and content between these two moments.</p>","Deciding Not To Decide: The Metropolitan Community Church,  The National Council Of Churches, And Competing Visions Of Liberal Christianity"

In this context, a major figure in the history of decolonization and revolutionary theory in the twentieth century, the Trinidadian Marxist-Leninist intellectual C. L. R. James, arrived in Washington for his little-studied decade-long residence. There, he committed himself to wrestling through the paradoxes and necessities of an international moment when numerous activists and ordinary people were questioning the limits of political independence and pressing to ensure it was not an end point but a beginning. As the star professor of history, literature and philosophy at a key institution of decolonization in D.C.—the public, black-majority Federal City College—James set out to draft a new history and sense of the historical discipline, nourished in careful intersubjective relationships with black Washingtonians. The idea of James in the seventies is anomalous to his popular scholarly receptions. I argue here that his time in Washington captured a crucial phase in his intellectual labor, in the citys decolonial history and in the larger effort to theorize decolonization into the seventies explicitly along the grain of critical history, and that it dovetailed with James reengagement with black feminism. By focusing on the late James, I plumb aspects of his output directly engaged with the idea of history as a tool and a discipline that a far-reaching project of complete decolonization and revolutionary change needed to grapple with and reinvent.</p>","Decolonizing History: Late C.

Irwin McDowell that he should not wait to train his army; instead, he should engage the Confederate Army since you are green, it is true, but they are green, also; you are all green alike. Because of Lincolns pressure, McDowell moved his army into Virginia in July 1861, fought, and lost, a battle near Bull Run Creek and the town of Manassas. True story or not, this assessment reflected an erroneous calculation of the military capability of each side. While the Confederate Army was composed mostly of volunteer units made up of amateurs, similar to Union forces, the nature of antebellum American military culture gave the Confederate forces a decided advantage. Southern societies maintained more effective local military forces to police their brutal slave regime. The free states had no such need and went to war with less efficient military units. This paper represents one part of my broader effort to reinterpret Civil War military history and challenge the persisting Lost Cause myth that Confederate victories demonstrated the superiority of their society. In one way, Confederate supporters were correct; holding 4 million souls to forced labor required a militarized society—a decided advantage when war came. For example, confederate cavalry dominated Union mounted forces, a superiority rooted in Southern riders experience in nightly slave patrols viciously punishing errant slaves. Establishing the relationship between the cruelty of prewar slavery and wartime military success deconstructs the most pernicious myth of the Lost Cause. </p>","Deconstructing The Lost Cause:  Enforcing A Slave Regime And The Origin Of Confederate Military Superiority"

In Detroit, a key borderland with Canada, restrictive quota laws prompted thousands of barred Europeans to cross the Detroit River illegally. Northern Europeans in the region, however, feared being labeled as illegal immigrants and founded an organization dedicated to ending quotas for their national groups and disassociating its Irish, German, and Scandinavian members with the stigma of illegality. Their activism helped associate northern Europeans with respect for the law and southern and eastern Europeans with unauthorized entry and crime. Thus, in 1920s southeastern Europeans earned a reputation for illegal entry, and police targeted their neighborhoods with deportation drives. Literature on 1924 immigration quotas has emphasized how federal laws set loopholes for Europeans that allowed their nationalities to gain legal status. On the ground in Detroit, however, southern and eastern Europeans faced deportation raids and nativist activism. In 1929 local police and Border Patrol officers launched a series of deportation drives in southern and eastern European neighborhoods that would set in place the infrastructure for Mexican repatriation drives in the years that followed. By investigating the local politics of immigrant activism, law enforcement, and nativism, this paper demonstrates that in the earliest years of American immigration restriction, certain Europeans earned a reputation for unauthorized entry that challenged their acceptance in American society.</p>","Defining The Illegal European And Protesting Immigration Quotas In The Midwest"

Dependency theory renewed discussion about the impact of the relations between the global North and South on the regions economic development. A term so evocative of imperialism circulated widely as the product of radical intellectuals and a region boiling in revolutionary ferment. As such, dependency became the challenge and counterpart of what has been the Cold War social science par excellence, modernization theory. Although different and sometimes competing ideas were incorporated in the umbrella term <i>dependency theory</i>, they were, the paper argues, not a product but a critique of the regional Left and the result of a vibrant intellectual challenge of the development of the orthodoxies of the global South not the North. Based on archival material, published papers, and as a part of a broader project on the history of <i>dependendistas</i> and Latin American development experts, this paper addresses the entwined histories of German-born but Chicago trained economist Andre Gunder Frank and Brazilian sociologist and future president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the two main exponents of dependency ideas.

Challenging The Nostalgia Trap In Politics, Popular Culture, And Historiography</h5></p><p>Although labor historians have often been harshly critical of the economic gains made by autoworkers in the early post-World War II era through the 1950s, a consensus has emerged that generous contracts negotiated by Walter Reuther and the United Auto Workers indeed propelled these workers into the middle class. Scholars have demonstrated that the reality was far more complicated for African American men and white women, but that fact has not prevented the consensus from gaining strength. This was a period when American autoworkers enjoyed steady employment, rising wages, and improved benefits in what was, by todays standards at least, a great time to be a member of the unionized working class. This paper, based on my recent book, Disruption in Detroit: Autoworkers and the Elusive Postwar Boom, argues that this consensus is deeply flawed, that these years were marked by job instability and economic insecurity for autoworkers. Many factors, including materials and parts shortages, strikes, recessions, hot weather, cold weather, the Korean War, plant explosions, overproduction, and the inability of autoworkers to purchase what they produced, contributed to this instability. Automation and decentralization led to long-term job losses from the region, but the descent was not linear, and chronic layoffs forced workers to struggle to make ends meet. Many supposed autoworkers managed to be actual autoworkers only half the time during the 1950s. Because few people in the 1950s thought that auto work was stable, this paper will also consider how scholarly and popular memory came to differ so starkly from lived experience.</p>","Detroit Autoworkers And The Elusive Postwar Boom"

Responsible for the killing of more than twenty Detroiters from 1971 to 1973, the DPD instituted the undercover unit in an attempt to halt what they believed was a surge in street robberies. Spurred by the murder of two black youths, this campaign against STRESS comprised a biracial coalition of liberals and radicals who challenged the unit in the courts, streets, and in public discourse. Members of this coalition engaged in various tactics in their quest to reform, then abolish, the unit, which included demonstrations, legal action, and discursive framing. The campaign to abolish STRESS illustrates how police killings brought liberals and radicals together at a moment when scholars argue that the Left had fractured. Yet, the left wings framing of the unit as a criminal enterprise in public discourse kept Detroit mayor Roman Gribbs and the citys police commissioner John Nichols on the defensive. The campaign, and the radicals critique of state criminality, opened up opportunities in electoral politics for radicals such as lawyers Justin Ravitz and Kenneth Cockrel and liberals such as Coleman Young. This critique of the carceral states criminality also demonstrates how visions of radical criminology—a field of inquiry that began to take shape concurrently—emerged out of political organizing and campaigns in Detroit.</p>","Detroit Under Stress: The Campaign To Stop Police Killings In The Early 1970s"

This research contextualizes the 400-year history of the racial wealth gap in terms of structural changes and the development of modern capitalism. Black Americans have been subject to bundled disadvantages that arise from how capitalism developed: individual barriers or impediments fall, but new ones take their place. The bundle persists in large part because racism infuses the structures even as they transform them. In the colonial era, property in black people was foundational to white wealth creation and transfer. In the early United States, the Republic became a modern economy through the stolen labor and productive capacities of African-descended people. And many structural features of that black dispossession survived emancipation in 1865. Slavery exited the bundle but was replaced by convict leasing and debt peonage. In the twentieth century, black Americans were excluded from programs leading to economic security and middle class formation. High opportunity costs for black Americans became part of the bundle. And the tragedy of the last fifty years is that at precisely the moment Black Americans were poised to claim the economic entitlements that so many white Americans had seized, real wages stagnated as owners rather than workers profited from productivity gains. Escalators into the middle class slowed and stalled. The tragic irony of the racial wealth gap is that the roots of black inequality are the same as the roots of American wealth stratification generally.</p>","Disinherited, Dispossessed, And Decapitalized: The Limits Of Black Wealth In America, 1619–2019"

During the Civil War, military officials and Northern reformers expressed anxieties about putting freedwomen back to work and shaping their character as wage workers. Industrial sewing schools organized exclusively for black women and girls emerged as an early solution. Funded by Northern capital and philanthropy and led by elite, Northern white women, the schools were more factory than classroom. Black women and girls produced tons of clothes shipped around the country and sold at below-market rates in place of free clothing rations at Freedmens Stores and by Army Quartermasters where no stores existed. The schools proved very profitable, in no small part because black women seldom received their promised wages. White women superintendents and teachers, aid society officials, and Freedmens Bureau officials found it impossible to reconcile black women as free-market actors and womanly dependents. Industrial sewing schools gendered racial capitalism. The schools reinforced black womens economic dependence and positioned white women as exemplars to degraded black womanhood. The schools ensured black women would never do well enough financially to challenge men as the legitimate providers for families and fitted black women for work for but not parity with whites, especially white women. The hierarchies of free-market relations, like those of the plantation household, quickly adapted themselves to the context of emancipation.</p>","Domesticating Racial Capitalism: Freedwomen And Industrial Sewing Schools, 1863–1872"

While both sides generally tried to avoid open conflicts, out of self-preservation if nothing else, the cultural differences were overwhelming, and the colonial expansion was a constant source of conflicts. On two occasions tensions rose into all-out war. The Pequot War and King Philips War had in many ways shaped early New England history and had a profound effect on New England colonies economy, politics and, perhaps most importantly, world view. Colonial-era writers and preachers examined in meticulous detail both the history of the wars and their implications for native-colonial relations and colonial world view. Colonial intellectuals, such as Cotton Mather and William Hubbard, were the first to explore those conflicts, but not the last—both wars still draw attention from historians and are still analyzed, reexamined and reevaluated. The question of how the colonists perceived the conflicts was answered numerous times (sometimes in contradictory ways). The native point of view of early native-colonial conflicts, however, remains underexplored. Reconstructing the native perceptions of the conflicts based largely on European-written sources is an important aspect in a number of studies, the place that those early confrontations have in the collective memory of native peoples is less known. Native Americans created throughout the 18th and 19th centuries a number of texts almost unknown to the general public, and even to anthropologists and historians. While a key part of Native American culture is, of course, its oral history tradition, it is worth noting that there exists as well a literary tradition, one created by the authors who have successfully navigated the dominant Euro-American culture while firmly maintaining their Native American identity. This paper examines the perception, the role, and the place of the Pequot War and King Philips War in 18th- and 19th-century Native American literary tradition.</p>","Early Native-Colonial Conflicts In Native American Literary Tradition"

This paper introduces the historical contexts that spurred liberal Protestant ministers of the FCC to speak out against venereal diseases and to work for social change through their partnership with sex educators. Their activism ultimately hinged on the discussion of sexuality within the framework of marriage and the family. As this paper will argue, the FCC became one of the practical arms of the sex education movement and played a central role in the movements shift toward family life education. The early cause of sex education gained a significant boost in 1914 when two movements came together to form the American Social Hygiene Association. The groups that merged represented the social purity movement—mainly liberal Protestant moral reformers seeking to abolish prostitution—and the social hygiene movement—mostly physicians working to raise awareness about venereal diseases. Protestant leaders from the FCC joined with social purity educators to soften the hard edges of scientific sex education by framing sexuality around Gods creation, Christian marriage, and the character training of children. The FCC also brought skills, data, and resources into the movement at a time when the hygienists had little practical experience instructing couples or children. FCC involvement ultimately shifted the movement away from warnings about venereal disease and prostitution, and toward the positive teaching of sexuality framed by marriage and the family.</p>","Early Sex Education And The Federal Council Of Churches"

At the same time, firms hired large numbers of women clerical workers and sales personnel to staff their growing corporate bureaucracies, which became a vast pool of contingent pink-collar workers by 1930. The majority of these pink collar workers received their training in schools, leading to surging enrollments and expenditures for publicly-funded education. Although economic, labor, and educational historians have noted these trends, less understood is the relationship between this enormous educational boom and the declining power of craft unions before 1930. Using historical census data, personnel records, trade journals, newspapers, and narrative testimony, this paper argues that while schools opened up new, eagerly sought opportunities for women and immigrant workers, the triumph of a school-based work force allowed employers to undercut craft union power and shift toward a work force made up of contingent staff under constant threat of replacement. While industrial unions in the wake of the Great Depression offered workers alternative paths to workplace power, the first decades of the twentieth century offer important lessons for rethinking the relationship between educational expansion, worker power, and social inequality in our own time.</p>","Educational Growth And Worker Power In The Early Twentieth Century"

Instead, Native Americans were more often presented as obstacles to progress. With the rise of the American Indian Movement and its precursor movements in the 1960s, some scholars and activists became interested in reforming how American Indian history was taught in schools. American Indian educators began organizing in 1969, and in 1970 formally created the National Indian Education Association (NIEA). Academic conferences were organized on the topic. In 1970 Jeanette Henry and her husband, Rupert Costo, edited a collection of essays entitled Textbooks and the American Indian. The couple would go on to spearhead the development of statewide educational standards for teaching about American Indian history in California public schools. Hundreds of thousands of children were taught lesson plans that Henry and Costo created, in which children constructed miniature models of missions and learned about their Indian inhabitants. This paper analyzes how the reformist curriculum was influenced by the ideas that activists had regarding Indian identity and culture. The activists were concerned not only with educating non-Indians but also with educating Indian children. They wanted to remedy low academic achievement among the Native American population and believed that incorporating American Indian culture into the curriculum might be one way to address historical inequality. The reform movement not only tackled K–12 issues but also led to the development of an institution of higher education for American Indian students. Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University (aka D-Q University) was founded in Davis as a two-year college in 1971. It was the first college for Indians established in California and one of the first few in the United States. This paper traces the development of K–12 standards for teaching Native American history in California, comparing and contrasting this process with similar developments in several other states. The paper examines the roles and contributions of the major participants in this process. By the twenty-first century, the methods and lesson plans of the 1970s progressives were coming under fire for working with stereotypical conceptions of Indian identity and for not being progressive enough. The paper also analyzes the recent criticism of the standards and how the standards are evolving in response to critics.</p>","Educational Inequality And Native Americans: The Historical Development Of Standards For Teaching Native American History"

For decades after World War II, New York City government had been a model of urban welfare regime, providing a wide range of social services and investing heavily in public works projects, all of which was enabled by substantial funding from Washington. But when New York plunged into fiscal crisis and threatened to default on its loans, the Ford administration refused to provide federal support to help the city pay its creditors. The austerity regime that followed involved not only steep cuts to the citys budget but also a new ideology of planned shrinkage that explicitly favored certain city residents and businesses over others. Private actors embraced strategic abandonment as well—exemplified by the arson epidemic in the South Bronx, where landlords destroyed their own property to reap insurance payouts. In the new global city that emerged out of the fiscal crisis, the health of the financial industry, despite its own conspicuous failures, became city halls top priority. Where municipal infrastructure had previously been oriented toward local residents, the city increasingly came to fashion itself as a broker for foreign capital and the global elite that accompanied it.</p>","Embracing Failure: New York's Fiscal Crisis And The Reorientation Of City Government"

This paper develops short case studies in the urban rust belt and emerging sun belt and explores how politicians in the 1980s, particularly an emerging generation of New Democrats (but not exclusively), employed public-private partnerships to make a political virtue of grim economic crisis-era necessities: of generating growth, tax yields, and, perhaps, sustaining a broader progressive policy agenda. But, as popular skepticism for government metastasized, these politicians came to defend governments role on two primary grounds: (1) that the policies were market-oriented; and (2) that they would ameliorate poverty at a moment when, thanks to Ronald Reagans draconian cuts to social welfare programs and popular critiques of liberal poverty policies such as Charles Murrays Losing Ground (1984), politicians at all levels of government felt called to offer solutions. Ultimately, however, New Democrats recourse to markets and public-private partnerships became a seductive way of avoiding direct responsibility for social priorities such as poverty while maintaining lip service for those same goals. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, public spending on business incubators and public venture capital pools (which primarily benefited entrepreneurs) and direct public subsidies and targeted tax abatements (which primarily benefited established corporations) became framed as market solutions for places in poverty that did not have anything to do with directly helping poor people. Beyond abandoning public policies to affirmatively redress poverty, framing government endeavors in terms of their market outcomes offered a thin sort of political legitimacy for the state writ large, yielding President Bill Clinton a notably desiccated political imagination when it came to defending public endeavor.</p>","Embracing The Market And Passing The Buck: New Democrats, Economic Growth, And The Evasive Politics Of Poverty, 1980–1995"

A key element missing from these historiographical discussions is the ways the Mexican American Generations educational history informed their campaign for integration. Though many of these Mexican American activists were products of the Texas public school system, several of them, during early childhood, attended escuelitas—a generic term for ethnic Mexican community schools, that literally translates to little schools.  The escuelitas Spanish-language, Mexican-centric curriculum provided these future activists with the tools they needed to advocate effectively on behalf of la Raza, but their very activism hastened the escuelitas demise. Escuelitas continued to be influential, however, long after their numbers diminished.  From the 1930s to the 1950s, several activists sought to integrate the escuelita curriculum into the public school system in the hope that altering public memory would affect public sentiment about the state of race relations in their own era. A more conservative group of Mexican Americans drew from another aspect of the escuelitas—the model itself.  These activists were less concerned with revising the curriculum and more concerned with teaching Mexican American children English before they began first grade.  While some were trying to change the system from within to make it more inclusive of Mexican Americans, others were trying to help Mexican American children become more acceptable to the system.</p>","Escuelitas And The Mexican American Generations Campaign For Educational Integration"

However, throughout the remainder of twentieth-century she meticulously curated her life using a concept I call the two-faced archive, a practice of publicly cultivating two distinct yet intersecting personas. Her songs, sultry performance style, and her feminine-presenting body constitute the first archive. She simultaneously created a second archive offstage in the form of letters, journalistic work, and her global travels as a black queer woman. Though she remained a private individual, by deliberately recording these archives with biographer Frank Taylor in the 1980s, she demonstrates a self-awareness of her role in history.  Current historical research on black womens lives benefits from a proliferation of black womens literary and historical work that emerged in the 1970s. Despite this materialization, a robust archive of queer black womens histories in scholarly writing remains lacking. My research contributes to the historiography of black queer womens history by contextualizing Hunters self-making practices through the purposeful archiving of her own life. Beyond double-consciousness, dissembling, and shifting, Hunter carves a path forward for black women in the American tradition of individualism and existentialism. In rejecting the trope of the tragic blueswoman and claiming race womanhood, her two-faced archive forces a reconsideration of the two most familiar readings of black womens lives.</p>","Everything Left To Prove It: Two-Faced Archives In Black Queer Womens Histories"

The first is that of the Firestone sisters, Shulamith, Laya, and Tirzah. Shulamith was an eminent radical feminist theorist whose life was destroyed by mental illness. Laya was a psychotherapist based in Hollywood, Florida. The youngest sister, Tirzah, is a Jewish Renewalist rabbi based in Boulder, Colorado. Through oral histories I am conducting with the surviving sisters and by reading texts produced by all three, I am atttempting to understand commonalities and differences in their belief systems. The second lens will focus on the life of Demita Frazier, a black feminist active in radical politics for more than five decades. Aside from her work as a theorist for the Combahee River Collective and an organizer in many arenas, she is also an unaligned Buddhist and works as a life coach. Through oral history in particular, I intend to explore the threads of spirituality, radical politics, and psychology, this time asking how they work together within a single life.

Black Americans engagements with the politics of international development were characterized by what I call an anticipatory critique of neocolonialism. On issues ranging from the Point Four Program in the late 1940s to Kwame Nkrumahs Volta River dam project in the late 1950s, the possibility of colonized territories—especially those in Africa—gaining political sovereignty while remaining in a state of economic dependency loomed large in black political thought. The anticipatory critique of neocolonialism led in multiple, sometimes conflicting directions in development debates. On one hand, the fear that the United States and European powers would continue to exploit the decolonizing world in the aftermath of formal independence was a prime reason to be suspicious of development projects that called for an influx of Western capital. On the other hand, recognition of the economic weakness of newly independent states could also point toward a desire for development aid, on the grounds that it would help build the state capacity necessary for newly independent nation-states to hold power in the international system. I argue that examining African American engagements with development thought and policy in the years following the Second World War reveals subtle but important shifts in the way African American internationalists conceived of the relationship between economic development and political self-determination.</p>","Facing The Neocolonial Future: Black Internationalism And Development Politics From Point Four To Volta"

Indigenous workers formed a parallel to southern slave plantations, as they were frequently forced from their homelands to live at the mission sites. Unmarried men and women were separated, put into separate and oftentimes locked living quarters, while their day-to-day lives were controlled by the padres. And yet, within this tightly controlled system, native people found ways to preserve elements of their cultural practices and to challenge the imposition of Spanish control and power. Within the largely patriarchal Spanish system, the role of native women was often delegated to the bottom rung of the political ladder. This talk will explore examples of native women who found ways to challenge this Spanish patriarchy. Within Californian indigenous communities, women had historically held positions of political and spiritual power long before Spanish colonization. Under Spanish colonialism, missionaries imposed new ideas of patriarchy, relegating indigenous women to subservient roles. Because of these biases within the Spanish archives and record keepers, evidence of indigenous women leadership during the mission era is scarce. My research reveals examples of women who continued to hold leadership roles within their mission communities. This paper will explore two examples, in the lives of Fausta and Sarafina, two women who played critical roles in helping their community survive and in challenging Spanish hegemony from within their communities. Faustas story illustrates how central female leadership was in the development and execution of the plan to kill the abusive Padre Quintana.

In the United States, the National Park Service launched the LGBTQ Heritage Initiative in 2014, a community-based preservation project that seeks to recognize the cultural legacy of LGBTQ individuals by adding relevant landmarks and memorials to the National Register of Historic Places. Currently, about 100,000 total sites and about 2 million contributing properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with 30 sites marked for LGBTQ cultural relevance. Community-based sociospaital justice projects have a considerable potential to challenge state-sanctioned definitions of normativity and to shift misperceptions of queer life. Yet, how does this investment in queer pasts rearticulate queer present and future? I also ask, what kind of histories are we investing in? What are the possibilities (if any) for the LGBTQ Heritage Initiative to be part of the the liberatory practices of queering space and spatializing the queer as articulated by queer urban geographer, Jack Gieseking (2013)? This paper considers this heightened homonationalist interest in LGBTQ pasts in the context of debates around confederate monuments in the United States and the global rise of xenophobia.

After securing federal aid in 1965 and growing skeptical about integration, liberals looked to state aid for equal but separate schools.  At the same time that both advocates of community control of schools and unionized teachers sought budget authority in the streets, a generation of professors of education and law sued in the courts.  Here, I tell these histories of education, labor, and school finance together in the person of United Automobile Workers and American Federation of State, Country, and Municipal Employees lawyer Abraham Zwerdling.  Zwerdling led the Detroit Board of Education that ushered in public sector unionism in 1965, filed the first school finance reform lawsuit in 1968, and rezoned high schools for racial integration in a 1970 decision that ended metropolitan busing when the U.S. Supreme Court took up <i>Milliken v. Bradley</i>.  After the California case Serrano v. Priest proved the one child, one dollar theory in 1971, the Ford Foundation invested in legal and community organizations to challenge the constitutionality of funding schools through property taxes in state courts across the country.  During the two years this legal precedent lasted, the labor movement proposed new school finance systems, provoking a competing theory of constitutional tax limitation as early as Californias 1973 Proposition 1.

Williams represented one of many African American public health workers, physical education teachers, reformers, and athletes who used exercise to bolster the health prospects of black people in the early twentieth century. This paper argues that black women augmented their public health campaigns by integrating exercise into their health activism. Black women promoted exercise as not only a public health good but also a physical act with implications for real and imagined forms of racial competition and posterity. This paper describes, for example, how black girls and women who achieved fitness through exercise could better the race and secure its future existence during the era of physical culture. It shows how physical culture influenced racialized and gendered narratives of wellness, and posits that exercise is critical to the history of public health and black constructions of health.</p>","Fit Bodies: Black Womens Exercise And Public Health In The Early Twentieth Century"

In the 1870s and 1880s, the economic success of Hawaiis U.S.-dominated sugar industry hinged on an expansive network of steamships that imported laborers from East Asia, Polynesia, and Europe. Regardless of a ships point of departure, migrants were lodged into overcrowded and unhygienic living quarters conducive to the spread of infectious diseases. This paper charts the medical microhistories of two steamships: the SS Lydia, which departed from Hong Kong in 1881 carrying smallpox and nearly 600 Chinese migrants, and the SS City of Paris, which departed from Madeira in 1884 carrying measles and nearly 950 Portuguese migrants. Drawing on ship surgeon journals, port physician records, and Hawaiian and American newspapers, this paper explores three questions: Who was deemed healthy enough to withstand the conditions and duration of transpacific travel? How did medical treatments differ depending on a passengers race, class, or gender? In what ways did migrant laborers resist the medical surveillance they were so often subjected to? Such questions intervene in recent scholarship exploring how contagion, race, and the human body were understood from the immobile vantage points of colonial settlements, cities, or nation-states in the Pacific basin. This paper contends that transpacific vessels, as self-contained communities in constant transit, offer historians alternative lens through which to examine the medical epistemology of public health.</p>","Fit To Float?

Less known, however, is how gay pride activists also used her ideas about normal homosexuality to intervene regarding the direction of gay rights organizing in the late 1960s, particularly militant brands of gay liberation activists and how their use of normal homosexuality inspired new formations of urban planning and design. Examining documents related to the research and influence of Evelyn Hooker on the Municipal Elections Committee of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Gay Community Services Center, this paper demonstrates that gay rights activism borrowed heavily from the rhetoric and strategies of the black pride, community mental health, and antipoverty movements of the 1960s. Rather than see depathologization of homosexuality as an end goal, activists saw depathologization of homosexuality in 1973 as a first step to a much larger plan to access the largesse of antipoverty and community mental health funds available to communities of color. This paper demonstrates that self-avowed moderate forms of gay rights activism culminated, by 1984, in a city ordinance–enforced homeless district to police black and brown trans and queer subjects separately from gay city neighborhoods and gay elite-supported initiatives to close bathhouses in light of the AIDS crisis.</p>","From Perverts To Politicians: Community Mental Health, Anti-Poverty Funding, And Homosexual Respectability In Los Angeles, 1965–1986"

The paper views picture brides, war brides, and military brides as linked phenomena that highlights the importance of female intimate labors to Asian exclusion, marriage, and migration.

What political power do citizens yield to their representatives and what do they retain as individuals? What should a citizen do when they disagree with the choices of their representatives? In the early republic, Americans grappled with the same set of questions as they made sense of their transition from monarchical subjects to republican citizens. While some claimed a revolutionary right to protest unjust legislation, others argued that the nations representative government rendered such actions illegitimate. This paper frames the first party system as a disagreement over the citizens role in a republic. Republicans believed that the Revolutions legacy guaranteed citizens the right to resist government when it overreached. They argued that the Revolution had been about popular resistance to tyrannical legislation. To them, popular sovereignty went beyond the mere act of electing representatives. It also granted citizens the right to scrutinize government conduct and resist unjust legislation through popular action, such as petitions, resolutions, and in extreme cases, outright resistance to the law. In contrast, the Federalists argued that resistance tactics developed under a monarchy had no place in a republic governed by elected representatives—Americans need not protest laws of their own making. Federalists believed that the Revolution secured representative government as the means to protect American liberty and maintained that citizens must support and obey decisions made by a majority. If unhappy, citizens needed to wait until the next election for recourse. While most scholarship frames the partisan conflict of the 1790s as a debate over foreign policy and political economy, this paper argues that it was also a fight over the place of protest in American democracy.</p>","From Rebellious Subjects To Obedient Citizens: The Contested Rights Of Protest In The Founding Era"

George Houser, Tim Smith, Bob Hall, Prexy Nesbitt, and New Left campus radicals with ties to Union Theological Seminary and the National Council of Churches joined in this effort.  At the same time, the idea of power structure analysis was stretched accommodate the research activities of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Saul Alinsky, black power activists, radicals opposed to American foreign policy toward Latin America, and the anti-war activists and liberal Protestant denominations who pioneered the use of shareholder activism to target Dow Chemicals and other firms over weapons production.  In dialogue with South African exiles, but also in response to wide-ranging domestic debate about racism, poverty, and the environment, the international anti-apartheid movements search for politically useful financial data helped reorient the American Left over the next three decades toward the thorny question of corporate power.

As a result, pregnant crack cocaine addicts risked losing everything, from their children to ownership of their bodies, in particular, their reproductive health. New laws criminalized their pregnancies and demanded jail time rather than treatment and rehabilitation. The rehabilitation available at this time often reflected the needs of men and ignored the struggles of women drug addicts. When taken in combination with the already-negative media portrayals of drug abusers that slanted public opinion against these women, laws that labeled crack-addicted mothers as child abusers garnered intense public antipathy. Not only were the reproductive rights of drug-addicted women on the line but their ability to nurture and mother their children was also called into question. This research explores the intersection of race, class, and gender to demonstrate how inner-city crack-addicted women, in particular mothers, were seen by the American public as the antithesis of the traditional conservative family values that emerged in the 1980s. American women addicted to crack cocaine in the 1980s and 1990s were objects of public contempt and as a result, faced harsh criticism and systemic mistreatment. Through an examination of a variety of media outlets, legislation and political agendas, as well as scholarship from fields such as public health, sociology, and criminology, this work orients the treatment of women crack addicts within the historical context of both the backlash against womens rights and the desire to cling to conservative family values established in postwar America.</p>","Geeking And Freaking: Public Perceptions Of The Women Addicts Of The 1980s Crack Epidemic"

Women and men of all ages and classes thronged to meeting houses and lyceums where naturalists expounded on the newly deciphered history of the ancient Earth. Geologists regaled their sometimes rowdy audiences with stories of cataclysmic explosions, floods and mass extinctions while flourishing colorful maps, minerals and fossils—the relics key to unravelling these mysterious former worlds. But geology was not just popular; it was political. As the premier science of the internal improvements era geology both determined the routes of new canals and railroads and illuminated the travel guides that followed them. Between 1824 and 1879—when the U.S. Geological Service was formed—every state, federal territory (and even far off lands such as the arctic) received some form of government sponsored geological survey. These surveys transformed geologists into a new class of civil servants which made them even riper targets than they already had been for parody, satire, and even sabotage! Geologists across the country were skewered by a skeptical public in newspapers, serial novels, travel guides and in the records of legislatures and assemblies across the country. Suspect politicians and the hard of hearing alike confounded geology with theology and phrenology, sometimes effectively undermining these publicly underwritten surveys and sometimes just bruising scientific egos. Geologists struck back with their own witty jabs in scientific journals, letters and field-notes where they mocked their scientific rivals and the illiterate lawmakers who controlled the fate of their new careers.</p>","Geology And The Hundred Other Ologies,: The Role Of Parody In The Making Of The First Public Science"

By the 1970s, though, postpartum depression became a feminist issue. As the feminist womens health movement grew, it had to strategically negotiate the medicalization of child birth and womens suffering. In many cases this meant the rejection of the medical establishment and an embrace of midwifery and home birth. For postpartum depression, however, there was no consensus. Increased attention to maternal mental health, especially this new diagnosis of postpartum depression, meant attention to womens emotional distress after birth—something womens health activists desperately wanted. It helped some women get psychological help and occasionally even a legal defense. Yet the same discourses that could be useful for individual women risked reifying the idea of women as mentally unstable and ruled by their hormones, and risked naturalizing establishment ideas about maternal adjustment. It also complicated arguments about whether womens depression should be understood as individual or societal, and what the threshold for mental disease was. In the 1970 Boston Womens Health Collective described what little research has been done on postpartum depression as heavy with male bias and conventional attitudes about motherhood, but they still did not reject hormonal causes entirely. In the years that followed, activists increasingly embraced more medicalized interpretations. I engage with histories of medicalization, the antipsychiatry movement, and 1970s feminism to explain the early but incomplete embrace of the postpartum depression diagnosis in the womens health movement.</p>","Good Adjustment?

Cass, Michigans federally appointed territorial governor and superintendent of Indian affairs, asked the Indian to affirm that he wore the British medal not as an authority, or power, but as an ornament before the American would smoke the calumet (sacred peace pipe) with him. In response, according to the memoirs of another American official, the Ojibwa took [the medal] from around his neck and laid it on our table, saying, he put no value on it. The pipe was then smoked, and an American medal given him to take the place of the English one. The American medal was nearly identical. It featured the face of President John Quincy Adams. A half century after Americans declared independence from the British monarchy, U.S. political culture remained monarchical in a key respect. American officials sought to dislodge Great Lakes Indians from the British sphere of influence not by presenting the Republic as a fundamentally different polity from the mother country, but instead by co-opting British modes of diplomacy. In this context the president was a rival to the British King, and, for that very reason, an analogue. Both British and American officials in Indian country used such methods as gifts, oratory, marriage alliances, and trade to encourage native peoples to feel a sense of kinship with a powerful yet benevolent Great Father to the East.

The songs narrator portrays himself as a down-on-his-luck boxer up against the ropes, having to kick and scratch and claw to survive. Of course, the term Great White Hope has a long history, dating back to the early 1900s search for a white prizefighter to defeat African American champion Jack Johnson. This paper shows how midwestern arena rock bands such as Styx utilized coded racial references to appeal to whiteness in an age of Reaganomics and anti–civil rights backlash. Styx originated in the Chicago suburb of Roseland in the 1960s, when three descendants of Italian immigrants formed a band called The Tradewinds (later renamed Styx). Although some historians have argued that Chicagos Italian immigrants were white upon arrival in America, this paper follows historiographical assertions that such immigrants were, in fact, in-between peoples who were working toward whiteness at midcentury. Music was one way they did so. Such bands popularity was based in part on their appeal to white listeners who apparently felt like white hopes struggling against a rising tide of deindustrialization and perceived gains by African Americans. This paper utilizes primary sources including newspapers, lyrics, and band members memoirs to explore arena rocks racial politics in the age of Reagan. It engages secondary works by historians including Jefferson Cowie, James Barrett, and David Roediger.</p>","Great White Hopes: Arena Rock Politics In The Age Of Reagan"

They organized against the Vietnam War draft, they created and uplifted art that celebrated black identity, they used popular education to explain Marxist ideas about global capitalism and revolution in working-class communities, they used a sociological approach in their community work, and they were grounded in the racial, cultural, and historical realities of the Puerto Rican lumpenproletariat. The Proyecto worked across the island over a twenty-five year period, at times clandestinely, and at times in solidarity with other groups, particularly during the 1980s on campaigns related to Haitian and Nicaraguan solidarity. In addition, the Proyectos founder, Dr. Ana Livia Cordero, left behind organizational documents that offer a unique perspective of Puerto Rican society that was ahead of its time in terms of its analyses of the effects of imperialism, racism, and capitalism on Puerto Rico, and what the Puerto Rican people could do in response. Despite the richness of the Proyectos story, the group continues to be affected by various forms of silencing that I interpret as rooted in anticommunist repression. In this presentation, I will explain how the nature of the Proyectos activities during such a tense period of the Cold War made it the target of smear campaigns that have had significant historiographical implications.</p>","Historiographical Legacies Of Anti-Communism: The Case Of The Proyecto Piloto De Trabajo Con El Pueblo"

By the 1980s, however, generational frames had been adopted by conservative critics of the welfare state to argue that the baby boom generation threatened the viability of Social Securitys old age insurance program. Data once intended to plan for a new state program influenced ideas about the shape of ordinary lives and then became a tool for dismantling the system that created it. The paper draws on primary sources from the Social Security Administration archives, published government and social scientific reports, and the proceedings of conferences held by Americans for Generational Equity. It employs methods from science and technology studies to discuss the cultural power that allowed the Social Security bureaucracy to affect the way ordinary people understood their lives. Unlike much historical work on Social Security, it is less concerned with the political horse-trading that founded the system and fueled its expansion than with its changing cultural influence. It has a closer kinship with histories of Social Security and the welfare state that have been attentive to the ways the program instantiated and propagated norms concerning gender, race, and sexuality. In that vein of scholarship, this paper looks more closely at new norms concerning age and generation that developed in the context of Social Securitys ascent.</p>","How Social Security Shaped Americans Ideas About Generations And The Courses Of Lives"

Rosamond Johnson, wrote a Broadway operetta, The Shoo-Fly Regiment, in 1905. It quickly became a collective dress rehearsal for black colonization to the Pacific. This spontaneous cultural turn augmented the actual migration plans already underway among black activists. By permitting black audiences to travel intellectually, affectively, and creatively to the Pacific through a staged performance, the Johnson brothers created a new virtual migration where ideas were explored, debated, and reimagined. While the reality rarely matched the fantasy, actual black confrontations with Jim Crow in Americas Pacific empire took shape with these expectations in mind. While another world was possible, the legacy of slavery and the constraints of empire refused its engendering. What developed, instead, was a collision of past, present, and future that might best be described as an Afrofuturistic dream confronting a deeply Afro-pessimistic lived reality. Through a deep reading of a newly discovered copy of the plays script against various War Department dispatches, this paper juxtaposes the Johnson brothers fictional rendering of a black Pacific with James Weldon Johnsons negotiations (both for and with) Americas Pacific empire as an (African) American diplomat in Venezuela and Nicaragua. This paper argues that the lines between fantasy and reality blurred into one another in the shaping of a black Pacific—both masking and illuminating its material conditions.</p>","Imagining A Black Pacific: Empire, Culture, And The Birth Of Afrofuturism"

With President William McKinleys declaration of war in April of 1898, many members of the movement believed that they had found a loyal ally in the United States. However, they failed to realize that many influential Americans had developed a loyalty to Spain and an imperial conceptualization of stability that superseded the movements call for independence. Additionally, many U.S. military officers and colonial administrators who initially believed that they had been sent to Cuba to establish Cuban independence developed a sense of comradery between themselves and their imperial counterparts, which continued to relegate the Cuban people to the position of colonized subject. This paper examines how U.S. military officers and colonial administrators perceived the Cubans and the Spaniards who they encountered on Cuba during the Spanish-American War and the subsequent military occupation of the island. Although many Americans initially admitted to being influenced by the yellow press, their perceptions changed once the fighting was underway. Immediately, U.S. personnel began drawing racial, military, and imperial similarities between themselves and Spanish troops. Once the war came to an end, U.S. military officers and colonial administrators continued to profess a sense of comradery with their imperial counterparts, which had initially developed in the metropole of the American Empire and was now being employed in the imperial periphery.</p>","Imperial Comradery In The Periphery Of Empire: American-Spanish Relations On The Island Of Cuba, 1898–1909"

In August, a strike in the Navy Yard fueled a citywide race riot. Meanwhile, Francis Scott Keys brother-in-law Roger B. Taney saw his stalled nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court suddenly resurrected. After Chief Justice John Marshalls death in July 1835 and the riots in August, President Andrew Jackson nominated the controversial Taney for the second time. Amid this political turmoil, forty-year-old Daniel Bell launched a delicate and potentially dangerous bid to free his wife Mary and their six children. As Key pursued a conviction and Taney vied for a seat on the nations highest court, Daniel Bell managed to buy his own freedom, escape the slave trade, and for the moment, keep his family together. Little has been written on this significant series of events and the way enslaved people used the law and navigated the citys networks. This paper seeks to explore the intersection of slavery, violence, and the legal system by applying a spatial analysis to early Washington, D.C.

In this presentation, I will seek to explore the life histories of two women, H.L. Tobing and Minar T. Rony, in terms of their relationship to the state within an interimperial context in the twentieth century.  In these women&quot;s journeys traversing the Dutch, German, Japanese, and U.S. empires, their experiences were characterized by the fundamental need to overcome inequalities within an interimperial context.  I will argue that their understanding of empire suggests an inter-empire temporality, in which one empire followed another, and required them to adapt accordingly, not only in terms of daily life-style and economic means, but also in terms of education and language.  At the same time, given the constraints of their gendered roles as they encountered these different States, both women also sought to gain positions of equality, despite the racialized and gendered realities that they negotiated.  In particular, my paper will focus on these issues regarding their trans-Pacific encounters with U.S. empire as knowledge workers during the Cold War in both Indonesia and the United States, where they served as cultural informants and language teachers, a reflection of the intensified U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia during that period.

As the chairman for the National Citizens Council for Migrant Labor wrote in 1948, The only recourse Mexican workers will have is through their Consuls. While other noninstitutional options existed for Mexican workers, the efforts of an activist consul could help braceros address a range of inequalities in the agricultural fields: from recovering lost wages, to improving work and living conditions, and secure other fringe benefits. The amount of support provided by a consul for intervening in bracero-related cases varied drastically from consul to consul—there was no standard reaction by consular representatives to complaints raised by Mexican nationals. During the mid-1950s, the attentiveness of Detroits consul to bracero concerns, at times, bordered on apathy. In fact, during this period some incidents in Michigan required the intervention of Mexican consuls in Texas. Focusing on Detroits Mexican consulate during the bracero program, this paper will examine how braceros attempted to challenge labor inequalities via the local consulate, as well as the frequent ineffectiveness of this institution.

Dell Upton, Renee Romano, and others have expressed concerns over this dual commemoration. During the civil rights movement, the terms integration and desegregation were used interchangeably, even synonymously. However, from a contemporary perspective, while integration can be taken to refer to the inclusion of African Americans and the centrality of race in American history, real desegregation would require an innovative reconciliation of those frustratingly paralleled memories, showing a more nuanced history of race as well as contestation over its memorization.

I trace and analyze how the TWWA organized, trained, and developed Third World women to fight capitalism and the ways in which their efforts enhanced the national liberation struggle by attracting women who were not interested in joining gender-mixed organizations or who were turned off by the machismo in other groups like the Black Panther Party (BPP).TWWA directly challenged the discourse of masculinity that permeated much of the Black Power movement. While some groups designated men as warriors for the revolution and formed all-male cadres, TWWA members believed that women had a significant role to play in armed struggle. They identified Black and Third World women as one of the most revolutionary forces confronting the U.S. ruling class. Although other revolutionary Black Nationalist organizations claimed to be the vanguard, I argue that the TWWA was unique in its assertion that Black women were well positioned to draw the masses into revolutionary politics because of their potential to be the most class-, race-, and gender-conscious and politically advanced group.I contend that the TWWA approach differed from other revolutionary organizations and the Black feminists who were active within them. Although women in the BPP rejected the masculinist rhetoric of armed self-defense and were trained in karate and the use of firearms, they had to struggle with Panther men to be considered revolutionary fighters. The TWWA assumed that women were capable and valuable members of the Black liberation struggle—and central to the fight for freedom.

Curiously, the fitness industry prospered. This paper argues that after 9/11, fitness, often rebranded as the more holistic wellness, was no longer considered a frivolous leisure pursuit, but a core requirement to full selfhood in an age of uncertainty. The apparent diversity of the fitness marketplace reflected the universalism of this assumption: once-marginal yoga that asked people to let go as a form of self-care surged in popularity. At the same time, tracking enthusiasts quantified every step and calorie. Gleaming boutique gyms opened in affluent zip codes, while Crossfit and its stripped-down, militaristic boxes attracted cops, cadets, retirees, and single mothers alike. Diverse as these offerings might seem, all championed cultivation of the body as a path to health, community, and success… and all were available for purchase in a private, consumer marketplace. This era did offer a glimmer of hope for a more inclusive, public investment in exercise as the Obamas made democratizing fitness a policy focus as had John F. Kennedy a half century earlier. Yet the Obamas differed in focusing their efforts on working-class people of color rather than affluent white suburbanites, signaling a shift in whose bodies had become problems to fix with a personal commitment to fitness that had become often difficult to access. Nonetheless, such policies unquestionably expanded the emancipatory aspects of exercise as for everyone and reinvigorated a public responsibility to ensure this right, though as the Obama years closed, fitness stubbornly remained another sign of growing income inequality.</p>","Its Not Working Out: Fitness And Inequality In The 21st Century"

Planters and slaveowners, like their British fathers, men such as Alexander McGillivray often lacked traditional lines of authority and favored new political structures, which reduced village autonomy to increase Creeks diplomatic force against the United States. This paper investigates another such man–John Galphin, a rival of McGillivray, whose brief appearance in the historical record contributes to discussions of borderland identity and nation-building. A son of the trader and Patriot Indian commissioner George Galphin, John Galphin partnered with the British renegade William Augustus Bowles to declare an independent state on the Gulf Coast. This territory, which had been reserved for Creeks before the Revolution, was now claimed by the United States and Spain as western Georgia and East Florida. Galphins partnership with Bowles illustrates his simultaneous enmeshment in the world of British American settler colonialism and in Creek strategies of international diplomacy. Having inherited a portion of his fathers plantation, purchased from a Creek land cession, he now welcomed British loyalists to settle as citizens in Creek territory.

Some studies have portrayed these governmental agents as racist oppressors, while others describe them as benevolent managers of the unfortunate wartime hostages. For example, historian Richard Drinnon portrayed Dillon S. Myer, director of the War Relocation Authority (WRA), as a keeper of concentration camps in his 1992 book, while historian Roger W. Lotchin in his recent book argued that WRA officials allowed Japanese Americans freedom and entertainment as long as they did not disrupt the camp order. Other studies insist that the administrators were sympathetic to the incarcerees plights and showed understanding for the incarcerees cultural traits, particularly in the camps where officials had experienced managing Native American reservations. To unravel these contradictory representations of the WRA officials who administered the fundamentally racist policy of Japanese American internment, it is necessary to distinguish between structural and idiosyncratic factors. By combining facts from archival findings and theories such as racial liberalism and settler colonialism, this study tries to present an integrated understanding of these officials involved in the wartime management of Japanese Americans. The paper will go beyond the question of whether Japanese American internment was racist or not and contextualize this historical episode in the shifting relationship between race, liberalism, and social engineering by the U.S. federal government.</p>","Keepers Of Concentration Camps?

When Robinson died in 2013 she left behind a house full of the evidence her lifelong engagement with radical politics: datebooks, correspondence, tax records, writings, photographs, political posters, record albums, and her vast personal library of hundreds of books, magazines, journals, and newspapers from around the world. Her spiritual practices, homemaking traditions, the items she collected, and the material culture of her life can also be gleaned from the contents of her home. Robinsons home archive reveals the myriad ways that black radical women engaged with politics beyond the private-public divide. Her personal history is a portal through which the print culture, homemaking practices, and intellectual engagements that sustained black radicalism for over half a decade can be understood. Analyses of the archival recovery of black womens history have centered on erasures, silences ,and the culture of dissemblance that shielded black womens inner lives from stereotype and scrutiny. This paper explores the potential of writing black womens lives centered on an archive steeped in their quotidian self-making practices. It considers the challenges and opportunities that come along with the institutional archival preservation process and offers a methodology for locating black womens radical politics that centers epistemologies sourced from their own lives.</p>","Keeping House: Patricia Robinsons Home Archives And The Preservation Of The Black Radical Subject"

Decades before federal agencies codified redlining, however, the capital that underwrote the first wave of mass suburbanization was already reshaping places as disparate as Antigua and Egypt. This paper reconstructs transnational circuits of people and capital to situate American residential segregation in a longer history tied to colonialism and imperialism. It does so by examining the multitude of investment practices revolving around land that British investors and their American intermediaries engaged in to finance suburban development. In the late nineteenth century, these included bundling and selling financial instruments backed by land debt, speculating on land that they advertised as open to white settlement, as well as purchasing and operating Caribbean sugar plantations. The result was a change in housing development practices that came to emphasize racial control as a means for ensuring long-term profit. The developers who spearheaded these changes played an outsized role in influencing American housing policy in the mid-twentieth century, which set the stage for a vastly unequal allocation of public resources that continues to this day. Extending the chronology of residential segregation highlights how developers and investors from around the world adapted white supremacy to new contexts while expanding its geography places Jim Crow spatial production in a more global framework.</p>","Land, Capital, And Segregated Suburbs"

Yet, scholars of the environment have been slow to examine the carceral state as a site of inquiry. What can be gleaned from the intersection of these two fields? What questions might we ask if we consider the development of the carceral state as a critical component of the environmental state? What sorts of motivations might scholars find? How has the carceral state molded how Americans experience—or do not experience—nature? This paper offers one look at what such a perspective may offer. Through an examination of events on the National Mall, at Mount Rushmore, and at Yosemite National Park in 1970, this paper argues that the creation of modern professional law enforcement forces within the national parks arose not out of resource or visitor protection, but as part of Richard Nixons war on crime. In attempting to enforce order in these spaces, the National Park Services chief aim was to make the parks feel safe for the suburban families that it saw as the core audience. In doing so, the agency embraced a vision of the national parks where law enforcement became integral to day-to-day operations. This talk suggests that the rise of the carceral state and the environmental state are mutually constitutive.</p>","Law And Order In The National Parks: Examining The Green Carceral State"

I trace how a group of these immigrants successfully lobbied through the 1980s for policy solutions to their legal status woes. Arguing that the historic contributions of Irish Americans should ensure continued opportunities for new Irish immigration, the Irish Immigration Reform Movement found sympathy in several policy makers with Irish ancestors and Irish immigrant constituencies. Media coverage of the plight of Irish immigrants in the 1980s cast them in a positive light; while the issue of undocumented immigration generally grew increasingly fraught in public discourse, the Irish did not seem illegal and their being stuck without status seemed to many an unfair fate. Together activists and Congress members worked to create a legislative solution, including a series of visa lotteries to benefit the Irish. At the same time, U.S. policy toward undocumented immigrants from other parts of the world, namely Mexico, Central America, and Asia, grew increasingly punitive in the 1980s and 1990s. Instead of addressing the problem of their undocumented status by creating pathways to legal status as it had for Irish immigrants, the United States made those immigrants lives more difficult by ramping up detention, deportations, and making it more difficult to adjust legal status. By creating a policy solution for white undocumented immigrants that afforded them legal status, while failing to do so for nonwhite undocumented populations, the United States reified undocumentedness—illegality—as a legal, social, and racial category.</p>","Legalize The Irish: How Undocumented Irish Immigrants Lobbied For Legal Status In The 1980s"

This paper begins with the views of Universalist Charles Chauncy (1705–1787) on individual reason and experience, which encouraged the international travels and conversion of his trainee Calvinist-turned-Catholic priest John Thayer (1755–1789). The next section explores the contributions of Unitarian William Ellery Channing (1780–1842) to Boston Associate Nathan Appletons (1779–1861) industrialization, particularly his fraught views about the moral exceptionalism of American industrialism within the context of Irish immigration.

Tying these three connections together are the ways international networks supported, combated, and made malleable claims to American exceptionalism within the liberal religious tradition. The liberal tradition is defined not just by the adherents belief in the total moral agency of human beings but also in their privilege in knowing and the responsibility to live out this religious principle. How should Americans learn from those they deemed less enlightened? What responsibilities do benevolent Americans have toward the less fortunate?

It argues that African Americans used areas of civil law, such as the common law of common carriers, including the principle of comportment, and cultural scripts such as respectability and vulnerability to convince white judges and jurors to award them damages. I show that blacks used specific areas of civil law to seek recourse for white violence, suing for negligence, civil assault, and wrongful death. Filing these civil suits seeking remedies for white violence allowed African Americans to circumvent hostile criminal courts, to pursue some semblance of justice. By petitioning civil courts for monetary damages, black plaintiffs asserted that black lives, black experiences, and black pain had value.&nbsp; Scholars have overlooked the struggles of ordinary black people who filed suit because these litigants refused to tolerate white violence without compensation for their pain. As a result, we have an incomplete picture of black life and of black legal culture—how blacks defined, made, reimagined, and applied law on the ground. By highlighting black civil suits involving white violence, my work recovers a specific form of resistance to white violence that is as important as resistance represented by mass protests or landmark cases like <i>Brown v.

Race, Religion, And Purity In The 20th Century</h5></p><p>From the turn of the century to the present, evangelicals have placed cultural and theological value on purity and sexuality. This paper tackles how concerns for purity continue to surface in the contemporary moment—one marked by emerging media, the proliferation of digital technologies, and increased attention and anxiety around racial difference. It considers how purity is taken up in a national evangelical womens group, Pinky Promise, and how new media influences pursuits of purity for its predominately black membership. Founded in 2012 by blogger Heather Lindsey, Pinky Promise is a global nondenominational parachurch movement that promotes traditional gender roles and defines proper sexual activity as heterosexual, marital, and monogamous. Framed as a promise to honor God in daily decisions and through embodied action, the organization offers sites, both digital and face-to-face, for members to connect around the everyday experiences that color a sustained commitment to a pious life. Digitally, the organization uses social networking platforms to encourage members to connect and share their stories and insights on how to effectively live for Jesus. Offline, the movement counts more than 1000 chapters in close to 30 countries worldwide, where women meet monthly for prayer and study, and to build relationships that reinforce a shared vow to purity. Notwithstanding the sociocultural processes that have coded purity as a sexual term over the course of history, and despite the ways it trends toward sexual concerns alone in the national organization, local members of Pinky Promise paint purity with much broader strokes. Rather than simply instructive of what, when, with whom, and for what purpose sex acts are permissible, purity for these women is about disciplining the mind, heart, body, senses, and desires to align with theologically conservative ideas of what is pleasing to God and what God requires of women who are committed to living according to His commandments. Purity captures the range of techniques and considerations, practices and motives—both religious and mundane—that map onto their understandings of their walk with Christ, how to honor God with their life and body, and what it means to present themselves as holy and acceptable unto God. Paying attention to the ways that Pinky Promise members construct purity as an everyday practice, this paper seeks to demonstrate how members religious lives, online and offline, reflect their larger pursuit of piety and self-coherence. By framing purity as a spiritual ideal, or proxy of what it means to live a good (i.e., correct) Christian life, it highlights how purity functions as a governing principle for Pinky Promise members, producing life-ways that are racially, sexually, and gender-specific. The paper wrestles with larger questions of how religious lives are imagined and presented online, how new media affects the way people believe, and how social constructs such as race, gender, and sexuality—and the religious commitments tied to them—take on everyday meaning and are lived out in a digital age.</p>","Living Right: Black Womens Pursuits Of Purity In A Digital Age"

However, this production illuminates the structural, cultural, and personal constraints of liberation during this era. Joseph Beam, a Black Gay writer and activist, died in his apartment alone of suicide, overdose, or AIDS complications. While his public activism and writing discusses liberation, it is his private poetry that illuminates many of these constraints. The institutionalized economic, social, political, and medical structural forces imposed on Black Gay men fabricated affective carceral experiences articulated through cultural production. Using an interdisciplinary approach, this paper details the ways in which Black Gay men were &quot;locked into&quot; a social, and literal, death in relation to the AIDS crisis as well as these societal pressures. While scholars have begun to interrogate the cultural production within the Black Gay Cultural Renaissance, not much focus has been placed on the spaces these poetic responses to carcerality are produced.

It argues that to account for this discipline as it functioned within U.S. geopolitical territory, we must situate it within the pharmacopoeial extractions, governmental alliances, and global markets that characterized the Anglophone world—and that suicide is a particularly revealing lens through which to do so. Historians such as Martin Summers and Susan Burch have called for greater attention to the ways, historically speaking, U.S. psychiatric programs have buttressed, and been buttressed by, state power. Placing medical files, annual reports, and architectural plans alongside newspapers, legislative documents, and the meeting minutes of professional organizations, this paper responds by extension: it goes afield of racialized patient groups and diagnostics within federal institutions to pursue the sensual materiality of therapeutics and suicide prevention at New York State Lunatic Asylum at Utica. The optics it develops—an optics of opioids, iron bars, and rubber feeding tubes—reveals the extent to which coloniality mattered not only for the experiences of institutionalized indigenous and African American persons but also for the functionality of the institutions themselves. The paper thus asks how attention to the materiality of suicide prevention might open broader questions about the psy-disciplines and the state, local markets as embedded within larger mobility regimes, and, not least of all, the trace impressions of empire.</p>","Madness, Materiality, Coloniality"

They arrived amid reports that Cuban officials had released many of them from prisons and forced them onto boats bound for the United States. A significant minority of these Cubans had spent time in prison, mostly for petty offenses, but sensationalist press accounts distorted their stories and helped increase apprehension about the new arrivals. In south Florida such fears converged with anxieties over rising crime rates. The overcrowded Dade County Jail in Miami became a specific site of contention. Although the jail had been under a court order to reduce its population for years, Miamians blamed the newcomers. They expressed particular alarm at the alleged inability of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to identify migrants in the jail and take them into custody. Elected officials relayed these concerns to Congress and insisted that the federal government must take responsibility for the people they called criminal aliens. Over the next decade, federal agencies and local police departments established new partnerships that addressed many of the demands issued in Miami after the Mariel boatlift. Scholars generally attribute this integrated regime of immigration and criminal law enforcement to federal initiatives that began in the mid-1980s. This paper suggests that this transformation owed much to local dynamics that emerged earlier—in Miami and other key cities—and helped drive a bipartisan consensus that increasingly framed immigration policy as a punitive form of crime control.</p>","Making Migrants Criminal In Miami: The Mariel Boatlift And Immigration Enforcement In The 1980s"

Federal judge W. Arthur Garrity made citizen participation a core component of the desegregation order, creating an extensive network of volunteer councils made up of parents and representatives of business, labor, cultural, education, and community institutions. The people who served on these councils donated inordinate amounts of time and labor to make schools work for their own and others children. Parents insistence on having a say in all aspects of their childrens education expanded their roles and increased their workloads. Meanwhile, school officials provided little support and frequently tried to obstruct council activities, while city leaders disinvested in public education, citing financial constraints. As a result, parent and citizen volunteers took on responsibilities that government officials had either abdicated or left unfunded. This research challenges popular narratives of school desegregation in Boston that paint Garrity as a tyrannical federal judge imposing his will on an unwilling populace, instead highlighting the work of citizens who supported integration and used the court order as an opportunity to implement broad reforms in the school system. It also shows how the voids caused by deficient political leadership and declining support for public services increased the burdens shouldered by citizen volunteers in the late twentieth century.</p>","Making Schools Work: Parent Labor In The Desegregation Of Boston Public Schools, 1974–1985"

In 1980 over 120,000 Cubans fled the island in a boatlift that would dramatically alter U.S. immigration detention practices. Most of the detainees were processed within a few months and paroled into the United States where they could apply for legal residency. However, a smaller group of 1300 were found to be excludable because of their criminal records in Cuba or because they were judged mentally unstable. By 1987, there were several thousand Cubans still languishing in federal prisons with indefinite sentences because they were deemed too dangerous to be allowed into the United States, or had committed crimes while in the United States, and, they could not be deported back to Cuba. In November 1987, after hearing the news that Fidel Castro had agreed to accept all of the Cuban detainees back, over 1,000 of them seized the detention center at Oakdale, took several dozen guards and prison employees as hostages, burned buildings, and demanded not be deported to Cuba. A few days later, over 1,000 Cuban detainees seized the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, taking nearly 100 hostages. The Cuban detainees complained that their indefinite detention was inhumane, and they demanded individual hearings to review their cases. After two weeks, both the Oakdale and Atlanta occupations ended after Attorney General Edwin Meese agreed to a moratorium on deportations and individual reviews of their cases. Although the detainees had burned several buildings, resulting in millions of dollars in property damage, only one Cuban detainee was killed (by a sharpshooter in Atlanta), and all of the hostages were released unharmed. In the end, the longest prison uprising was also the most non-violent one. These uprisings were the birth of the modern-day conflation of the criminal and the illegal alien, and they led to the massive expansion of the infrastructure of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to be able to lock up tens of thousands of immigrants.</p>","Mariel Cuban Refugees And The Longest Prison Takeover In The United States"

This paper exposes thecarnivalesque response of American blues musicians with the dialogic relationship of Americansocial norms, forming a narrative bridge between societal norms and a subaltern voice ofprotest. The Bakhtinian carnivalesque expression can be seen in blues songs by Blind LemonJefferson and the more satirical songs by Lead Belly and Nina Simone. The many languagemasks of American society are a cohabitation of various periods of socio-ideologicallife. While the official unitary voice of the American state as a whole would seek todisfranchise African Americans, the music of the blues demanded anaudience to lament their injustices. By juxtaposing American blues lyrics and performance ofthe early 20 th century to the state narrative, the carnivalesque link of change and rebirth can beexposed. Like the spirituals the blues were rooted in, the malleability of carnival music is in theongoing chain of statements and responses. Carnival became a way for the musician to speakcandidly about society without repercussions. This paper argues African American blues songswere a mask of dialogue that can be analyzed to better understand southern blackAmerican culture. While Bakhtin never turned his eye toward American culture, let alone thatof bluesmens lyrics, his theories offer an alternative story of black history, despite its clevercamouflage, that can be used as a historical tool.</p>","Masks Of Dialogue: Mikhail Bakhtin And African American Blues Protest Songs"

Capitalism, he argued, was defined by equilibrium. Crises, therefore, were caused by market distortion—in particular, the ways labor unions, unemployment relief, and minimum wage laws conspired against the natural tendency for wages to fall low enough to facilitate full employment. In contrast, Mises argued, a truly free market would have entailed wage cuts instead of layoffs; laborers would simply say Better a lower wage, than no wage at all. Was Mises right? Despite his still tremendous following, historically, Misesian prescriptions have had little bearing on historical reality. In fact, workers have often been quite resistant to the idea of taking any job—no matter how low paying or undignified—even when on the brink of privation. Dignity is an intangible and slippery concept. It may seem like poor ideological adhesive for historical theses, but my own research on industrial decline in Massachusetts shows how workers subjective sense of dignified labor repeatedly kept them from taking this Misesian bargain and opting for economic optimization. I show how local business leaders frequently wrestled with a phenomenon they found utterly perplexing—the so-called job paradox: surging rates of unemployment and unfilled jobs (ironically clustered in deindustrializing sectors). The problem, of course, was that workers were more discerning than expected. Historians too have implicitly reproduced Misesian logic, missing how workers own choices—and their desire for dignity—helped hasten industrial decline. </p>","Massachusetts, The Job Paradox, And The Political Economy Of Crisis"

The macroforces underpinning migrant agriculture produced a system of inequality, as it was designed to keep laborers deracinated. Images of their placement in these crop-combed fields abound in archives. But contrary to the photographic records of growers and government agencies, which generally portrayed Mexican laborers as vagrants and culturally vacuous, individuals I interviewed testified of a robust religious social life from the 1930s to the 1960s. The inequalities of historical record keeping have pushed historians to imagine new ways of telling the past. Chief among these strategies have been oral histories and material culture. In this paper, I show how three elements (sounds, sights, and sites) came to characterize performative aspects of everyday lives of Mexican Pentecostals on the margins of society and religious respectability and informed much of their social memory of a bygone era. How my interviewees reflected upon the photographic record may push us toward more fully understanding Latinx religious history and the sacred materiality of their past. Rather than particular events or places, interviewees mostly reflected on <i>la vida cotidiana</i>, that is, everyday life and the spaces of religious meaning making embedded therein. In the recollection of memories and life histories, everyday material religion took center stage their <i>testimonios</i>. </p>","Material Memories Of The Sacred: The Sounds, Sights, And Sites Of Mexican Pentecostal Farmworkers (1930–1966)"

This presentation considers such commemorative efforts by paying particular attention to two locations: Mississippi, where the widespread memorialization of Emmett Till has taken place in the 2000s and 2010s, and Montgomery, Alabama, where the Legacy Museum: From Enslavement and Mass Incarceration and the National Monument for Peace and Justice were opened in 2018. Since the renaming of a local highway as the Emmett Till Memorial Highway in 2005, Mississippi has witnessed an unprecedented memory boom to remember the 1955 murder of Emmett Till. This presentation explores how diverse and sometimes-contradictory memories of the incident—from the establishment of museums and history markers to the creation of several driving tours—are juxtaposed, contested and negotiated in the rural landscape of Mississippi. While these memory projects in Mississippi focus on one particular case, Montgomerys new museum and monument, established by a local nonprofit organization called the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), aims to remember lynching victims collectively. By closely looking at the museums Community Remembrance Project exhibit and the layout and design of the lynching monument, this presentation illuminates how the EJIs acts of remembrance not only reveal the magnitude of the past atrocities but also offer a space for collective mourning. This paper further scrutinizes limitations embedded in the EJIs memory projects. Analysis of and comparison between the cases of Mississippi and Alabama will clarify the politics of memorializing racial terror in the South.</p>","Memorialization Of Lynching In The South: Emmett Till, The Legacy Museum, And The Lynching Monument"

Chandler included Chan Kendrick, director of the West Tennessee ACLU, Black Panther party leader Janice Payne, and Michael Honey, Southern Regional Director of the National Committee Against Repressive Legislation. In the wake of Dr. Martin Luther Kings assassination, white police took revenge on the black community for its militant strikes and organizing; police murdered 17-year-old Elton Hayes and committed many acts of violence against young black men. The police Red Squad also attacked demonstrators, blew up an organizers automobile, and worked with the FBI to tap peoples phones and photograph their activities. This paper not only explores the repressive aftermath of the King assassination from 1968–1976, but also details the gains made in that time by union, civil liberties, womens, and black political power movements. We sued to stop surveillance and won; we made progress against racism and rallied against threats to civil liberties coming from the highest levels of the Nixon administration. This paper will also show that, beyond 1976, the city made great economic and political strides for civil and human rights. At the same time, deindustrialization, the loss of unions, and Republican rule at the state and national level took their toll, and Memphis now has the highest poverty of any city of its size.

Race, Religion, And Purity In The 20th Century</h5></p><p>This paper shows how American evangelicals transformed from the most implacable foes of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) victims domestically to the face of AIDS relief internationally. Drawing on never-before-seen sources, this research examines missionary work in the 1980s-2000s period and traces the ways that missionaries reshaped U.S. evangelicals views on AIDS and expanded abstinence-only education programs across the world. The paper demonstrates that missionaries shifted evangelicals understanding of AIDS by recasting the epidemic within the racialized affective hierarchies of missions, thereby rousing white evangelicals sympathy for and desire to save black and brown suffering bodies across the world. In the late twentieth century, American evangelicals were the majority of the worlds missionaries and their organizations were the biggest nongovernmental organizations in the world. But in the late 1980s, evangelical missionaries faced a major public relations crisis in the US. After several medical missionaries in West Africa died from AIDS, outraged evangelical donors and churches in the United States pulled their financial support from the affiliated mission organizations, and a few of those organizations folded as a result. Other missionary organizations scrambled to figure out how they could avoid a similar fate. How could they address the medical emergency in the field and the public relations emergency back at home? The threat of financial and public relations disaster forced mission organizations to confront the moral discourses that U.S. evangelicals had promulgated about AIDS. Missionaries wrote and traveled back to the United States in the 1980s and 1990s and spoke to churches, colleges, and national conferences about the importance of compassion for AIDS victims around the world. Several mission organizations partnered with the U.S. surgeon general to create curriculum for churches and evangelical organizations that debunked myths about AIDS and encouraged evangelicals to exhibit sympathy and care for people with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and AIDS. Through these materials and speaking engagements, missionaries and their organizations used their platform to reframe American evangelicals understanding of AIDS, not as Gods judgement for sexual immorality, but as the poignant suffering of black and brown people around the world that white U.S. Christians could relieve. Missionaries efforts to shift the evangelical conversation about AIDS into the more acceptable and well-worn register of global missionary work increased evangelical support for international AIDS relief and humanitarian work in the 1990s and early 2000s. That shift is what made possible the considerable evangelical support for U.S. policies such as the 15 billion dollar global AIDS initiative, PEPFAR (Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), first passed in 2003. This increasing evangelical support also refocused AIDS mission work from medical relief to prevention in the late 1990s. Missionaries promoted abstinence-only education by harnessing the resources of the U.S. purity movement and providing conservative moral lessons through health education that put medical science and biblical teachings on equal footing.</p>","Missionary Positions: How American Evangelicals Learned To Love Global Aids Relief"

One aspect of the long civil rights movement in Memphis was the push to revitalize the citys public hospital in a postdesegregation environment.  Although such a move was resisted by many conservative political leaders (mostly white), veterans of the 1960s desegregation movement who had become elected officials forged a governing coalition in the late 1970s and early 1980s to reform and expand the city hospital into the Regional Medical Center, which not only is the point of hospital service for Memphians without health insurance, but also is a leader in advanced medical treatment for neonates and victims of burns and traumatic injury.  This paper examines the means by which advocates for more equitable access to health care were able to achieve some measure of success during a period when conservative political forces were on the rise in Memphis and nationally.</p>","Mobilizing For The Med: Civil Rights Veterans Push For Better Health Care"

This was the case in Spain, a nation in political and economic turmoil and an imperial power on the decline. Influenced by the Enlightenment ideals of progress and rationality, desirous of regaining status among European powers, and desperate to hold onto its Philippine colony, the country encouraged the foundation of economic societies [Amigos del País] to support scientific and agricultural pursuits. While officials attempted to modernize and systematize government institutions in the Philippines, economic societies focused on ways to modernize and improve the economy. Education would serve both endeavors and became the cornerstone of colonial policy making. Universal education would train a native workforce to help administer the increasingly bureaucratic colonial state. Vocational schools would prepare Filipinos to participate in the colonys economy, which would ultimately benefit the metropole. Nineteenth-century colonial education was a key component in the imagining of a modern, economically solvent Spanish state.Historians have largely neglected Philippine education in the second half of the nineteenth century, instead focusing on the American colonial period. However, it was during this earlier time that education was expanded and secularized to serve a national agenda, a policy that continued into the American period. Utilizing legislation, government reports, and Amigos del País records, this paper addresses the imbalance in the Philippine historiography by tracing Spains efforts to utilize education for economic and political integration at home and abroad.</p>","Modernization, Economic Progress, And Education In Nineteenth-Century Philippines"

The rise of community psychiatry in the 1950s marked the first time in U.S. history when mental health professionals began to pay attention to the ways race shaped the field of mental health care. The literature on community psychiatry, however, describes the relationships that developed between white mental health professionals and patients of color through a declension or deficiency model. They characterize the political struggles of that radical experiment as a failure, and they frame racial and ethnic difference mainly as a pathology. Despite the sympathetic lens through which these narratives are written, they have racialized people of color by portraying them as mentally weaker than whites: African Americans are more vulnerable due to poverty, discrimination, and incarceration; Latinos verbal capacities are limited by their lack of English proficiency; Native Americans have high rates of suicide; and Asian Americans are undiagnosed entirely due to cultural stigma and shame. This narrative, however, ignores the mental strength that poor people of color demonstrated. This paper re-centers blacks and Latinos as scientific innovators within community psychiatry in the 1960s and 1970s—especially within the subfield of substance abuse treatment. It highlights the solutions that they developed to achieve individual and collective well-being through a combination of political education, group therapy, and non-Western forms of healing.</p>","More Than Radicals Or Junkies: Blacks, Latinos, And The Pursuit Of Psycho-Political Liberation"

Its theoretical framework follows Joel Braslows therapeutic discipline, which explains how a psychiatrist might consider a particular practice as a therapy while a patient might consider that same practice as an ordeal. Scholarship has depicted Bellevues electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) experiments as two distinct experiences belonging to Dr. Lauretta Bender and her six-year-old subject Ted Chabasinski. This scholarship has focused on an analysis of the experiments themselves rather than the background or experiences of the participants. They have described Benders actions and motivations in conducting such questionable experiments without analyzing them deeply other than to mention personal hardship she experienced after losing her husband. Scholars have shown how Chabasinski was traumatized by the experiments and how he became an attorney specializing in disability rights. However, no scholarship has analyzed his experiences in the context of therapeutic discipline. This paper argues that gender, class, and disability each played a role in creating different viewpoints. Bender decided proceed with such questionable experiments to protect her dual identity as a doctor and mother. Chabasinski was diagnosed with childhood schizophrenia largely because he was an adopted orphan of a poor out-of-wedlock immigrant with a psychiatric diagnosis.

García would ultimately be claimed as a hero for a narrative of Cuban nationalism; however, his loyalties were frequently questioned and tested as Cubas status as a sovereign nation was being decided first on the battlefield and then among diplomats and politicians. The paper first takes up the moment when García chose to collaborate with the United States on its plans to invade from eastern Cuba. Given that this decision had not been authorized by the provisional Cuban government in exile, Garcías choice and its impact would become a matter of controversy in Cuba. The paper then turns to the moment, months later, when García would break with the U.S. military when he resigned his command to protest the exclusion of the Cuban troops during the victory parade through Santiago de Cuba. For this he would later be lauded by Cuban nationalists. Finally, it takes up Garcías dismissal as head of the army in Oriente by Cubas provisional government and his subsequent appointment as a civilian member of a commission to negotiate for Cubas recognition by the United States. These incidents inform the papers argument that national loyalties were impossible commitments in a situation where political power worked according to the logic of imperialism and Cuba remained a nation-to-be.</p>","Navigating Equal Sovereignty: General Calixto García And The Cuban Nation-To-Be"

Promotional literature, such as Virginia Ferrars 1655 silk treatise <i>The reformed Virginian silk-worm</i>, frequently framed the phenomenon of silkworm metamorphosis as a natural sign for how cultivation of this insect might also transform or reform the English settler colonial project in North America. Combining elements of natural history writing and settler colonial promotional material, silk treatises endorsed indigenizing silk production in Virginia. Specifically, by transforming colonial Virginias tobacco fields into Mulberry orchards and Native American women and children into silkworm growers, New World ecologies might be interwoven into Anglo-Atlantic circuits of production that also included working-class English women and children employed as silk spinners in the Spitalfields region of London. The utopic commercial fictions produced by this literature imagined an Anglo-Atlantic economic world that weaves together Native American resources (human and animal) and emergent English forms of industrial production to bolster Britains commercial and imperial strength on a global scale. Reading seventeenth-century silk treatises through the lens of critical race studies, this paper explores how this writing conceived the settler colonial project and its concomitant ideas of race, gender, and geography.</p>","New World Silk And The Natural History Of Settler Colonialism"

SSNs are typically treated as incidental to the larger story of modern state building—or today, often as a risk, given that ones unique digits serve as an index to a trove of personal information.  My presentation instead examines the SSN as a window onto the ways Americans have envisioned the modern state and their own affiliation to it during a century when attitudes toward the federal government shifted dramatically but unevenly.  For example, the SSN for both African American laborers and wage-earning women in the early days of Social Security was a profoundly important—even cherished—marker of economic citizenship and economic rights.&nbsp; However, Americans have often prided themselves on being individuals rather than numbers, and the SSN was already in the 1930s a flash point for partisan battles over the size and scope of the U.S. state.  Contests over the import of these nine digits continue into the present, when SSNs are discussed as an (even the) enabler of state tracking and surveillance capitalism even as they are among the most prized possessions of undocumented immigrants.  By detailing some of these stories, I hope to shed light on not only the career of the SSN, but also the material and affective history of U.S. citizenship buried in mundane bureaucratic paperwork.</p>","Nine Digits"

The practice of sabotage was not new but the word was, and there was something distinctly threatening about naming the disparate, rebellious practices of disgruntled workers. Sabotage gave an intellectual coherence and revolutionary meaning to activity that could easily be interpreted as irrational, impulsive and disorganized. Much like the International Workers of the World (IWW) itself, the word organized the disorganized and legitimated what appeared illegitimate. It also became a lightning rod for legal repression. Its brief efflorescence and violent suppression indicates that an important relationship exists between economic interests and acceptable political expression. A single worker disabling a machine out of anger was inconsequential. When, however, this activity was translated into a critique of property and framed as a source of class power, it became unacceptable. The IWW was not the only organization that threatened wartime production with strikes and direct action. But it was the only organization to combine strike activity with the open advocacy of sabotage, a tactic that not only announced the illegitimacy of private property but also encouraged workers to practice a real, if temporary, form of expropriation and control. This paper suggests that sabotage is a unique example of the importance of the relationship between political theory and economic practice.</p>","No Interests In Common: Sabotage As Structural Critique"

Black women are rarely seen waitressing, as airline stewardesses, on corporate boards, or as professors in the academy. Colleges and universities (in-class or online) have no problem taking our money, signing us up for financial aid, while knowing well that the cultural, historic policy of their institutions is to avoid hiring us. This is racial discrimination of the highest order. In addition, black women suffer from gender discrimination and those who are middle-aged and older suffer from age discrimination as well. This study shows that at three south Florida institutions—Broward College, Florida Atlantic University (FAU), and Palm Beach State College (PBSC)—black professors make up less than 10 percent of the faculty, while black students are 30 percent of the 147,000 students attending these schools. Consequently, future or new educators, mathematicians, scientists, and business majors are not getting a culturally rounded experience in college. The intent of this study is to devise a proposal to find solutions to this problem, such as formulating a more concerted effort to identify and hire black professors, along with an intensive plan to retain them, which appears to be a huge problem at FAU and PBSC, according to presidents of both institutions.

While her attempt to defend herself in court illuminates significant revelations about the Progressive Era, her family genealogy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is equally informative and fascinating. Her family history offers a telling perspective on the myriad challenges to black freedom in Pennsylvania. Although Elias was born in 1865 Philadelphia, her story begins with family, specifically her maternal grandfather, David Lewis, who was born in May 1786 to Negroe Debe, an enslaved woman in rural Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. This paper focuses on the process of recovering Eliass family history as a way to think about the challenges of black freedom in the North. The archives of black women and family also opens up a new perspective from which to examine northern slavery and gradual abolition. How might we understand Pennsylvania enslavement through Debes encounters? In particular, when Debes enslaver documented Davids 1786 birth with the partial statement, David, a Molattoe Male Child, how might we begin to understand the sexual vulnerability and isolation that many enslaved women experienced on local farms in the rural North?

LaGuardia put together a biracial commission not only to explain the cause of the unrest but also to offer recommendations on how to prevent more. While scholars have written about the Harlem rebellion of 1935, about the roles of the Communist party during the Great Depression, and, more generally, about black politics during the depression, historical examinations of police brutality and the politics around it remain peripheral. This paper contextualizes the politics around LaGuardias commission and centers the problem of antiblack violence and political debates about and around policing in Harlem. Throughout the year of the report—which was released not by the mayor but the black newspaper the New York Amsterdam News—the New York Police Department occupied Harlem. This paper is two-pronged.

Activists understood the unique challenges women faced regarding AIDS both in light of the Reagan administrations efforts to restrict funding of family-planning services, and in light of the reproductive abuses of the past, when low-income women of color were vulnerable to pressure for institutionally prescribed abortion and sterilization. This paper sets the early response to AIDS among women against the backdrop of Ronald Reagans America and shows how activists learned about the emerging epidemic to inform women of their risk of infection while at the same time petitioning the federal government for equal access to medical care. My wider doctoral dissertation, Out of the Silence: Women Protesting the AIDS Epidemic, 1980–2018, examines the effect AIDS has had on women and the central role HIV-positive women have played in the concurrent political debates over abortion, sexual education, and mass incarceration in the United States from the 1980s to the present day. I analyze late twentieth-century U.S. history through the lens of HIV and put women into spaces where they are often narratively excluded. In doing so, I place the AIDS epidemic, and in particular womens resistance to it, at the center of U.S. politics and society in the 1980s and 1990s and trace its prominence to the present day.</p>","Of Childbearing Age: Aids, Reproduction, And The Reagan Administration, 1981–1989"

Crockett made a name for himself as the only African American lawyer to defend Communist party leaders in the Smith Act trials that began in 1949. When Judge Harold Medina cited Crockett and all other defense attorneys with contempt of court at the trials end, Crockett rose and declared that he regarded it as a badge of honor to be adjudicated in contempt for vigorously prosecuting what I believe to be the proper conception of the American Constitution. Thusly he met with his first major experience of state repression. Over the next two decades, the Federal Bureau of Investigation kept close tabs on Crockett, surveilling the interracial law firm he helped found and frustrating his attempts at elected office. When he ran for a Common Council seat in 1965 in Detroit, the FBIs Detroit office mailed anonymous letters to conservative groups, providing them fodder with which to red-bait him. Crocketts bid failed that year. The state aimed to kill his campaign again the following year when he ran for Detroits Recorders Court, but Crockett emerged the victor. What the long history of Crocketts experiences with state repression reveals, I argue, is that the executive branch could not subdue political activities on its own. It needed judges, police officers, media outlets, and eager citizens.</p>","Of Judges, Agents, And The Citizenry: Repressing George Crockett Jr."

Although Ewing resided in Little Britain Top, a small town in Lancaster County, he claimed he forced Robert, along with Quash, Wallaw, and the rest of his slaves to live on property he owned in neighboring Maryland. However, this particular piece of land straddled the boundary line between Pennsylvania, now a free-state and Maryland, a slave state. A close reading of the witness testimonies in this case reveals a distinct relationship between the institution of slavery and notions of state formation in the late eighteenth-century. By using the lawsuit against Ewing as a case study, my paper explores how slavery, race, and space converged along the Pennsylvania-Maryland border, reinforcing increasingly institutionalized understandings of state identity. I investigate the changing ways this particular cast of individuals understood these concepts following the 1780 act; and, consequently, how these perceptions reiterated geopolitical notions of the state in an individuals daily life. As a result, I argue the complex relationship between race, slavery, and space in relation to the creation of Pennsylvanias legal identity as a place where freedom is accessible even before the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and 1850.</p>","On The Edge Of Freedom: A Case Study Of Slavery, Space, And Race Along The Pennsylvania Border"

Throughout the Progressive Era, maternalist reformers created, in the words of Robyn Muncy, a female dominion in American reform. Proceeding on an ethic of protecting poor women and children, these reformers sought to ban child labor. In contrast, liberal policy makers after World War II created youth employment programs, notably Job Corps, to train youth for vocational jobs. As this paper will demonstrate, social welfare policy making after World War II was characterized by a shift from women who prioritized protection from labor exploitation for women and children to men who shared a widespread belief in waged labor as the answer to poverty. This gendered conflict was also apparent in the language liberals used to discredit maternalists and maternalist policy. Liberal policy makers argued that maternalists childlessness disqualified them from enacting reform for children even as their age and gender led them to a nostalgic and overly emotional approach to reform. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, critics insisted that child labor reforms, like the overprotective mother figure featured in 1950s attacks on American motherhood, smothered the ambitions of big boys. They argued that child labor laws encouraged juvenile delinquency by leaving high school dropouts at loose ends. Liberal policy makers thus posed poverty, juvenile delinquency, and other social ills, as not only a failure of individual mothers and families but also a failure of the maternalist state.</p>","Overgrown Boys And Old Maids: Cold War Debates Over Child Labor, Juvenile Delinquency, And Maternalist Reform"

Returning from diplomatic service in the United States in 1868, Domingo Sarmiento declared his intent to become Argentinas Schoolmaster President and enacted plans to import key features of U.S. public education to support economic modernization and political consolidation.  Sarmientos attempts to engage North Americans in this educational project (akin to Victoria DeGrazias concept of irresistible empire) were only partly realized. The Argentine government failed to capture interest from U.S. politicians, but it successfully harnessed the exploitable republicanism and aspiring global cosmopolitanism of unorganized, underpaid white women teachers. In exchange for transmitting lessons of individualism, moral self-mastery, and social mobility at the core of U.S. public education, women teachers earned salaries far greater than they could at home.  Dispersed to distant provincial capitals, their employment provoked some community opposition but also elicited support from elites whose interests were served by transnational webs of educative and economic relations.  Although they did not depart the United States identifying as migrant workers, some came to recognize how well that status described their condition. Aware of the vicissitudes of educational labor markets, these teachers made strategic use of chances for accumulating personal savings and cultural capital abroad.  With much to gain from growth of U.S. and Argentine state power and global capitalist expansion, they represented a distinctive constituency of midlevel workers in empire, who experienced both vulnerability and opportunity in development of global imperial projects.</p>","Overseas U.S. Teachers As Migrant Workers In The Late Nineteenth Centurys Global Imperial System"

The movements activism and the international treaties it helped produce were in turn instrumental to the passage of womens suffrage in numerous countries throughout the Americas. Although Latin American countries were chronologically in the middle in terms of womens suffrage legislation, Latin American feminists were in the vanguard of international and transnational feminist organizing.

The first woman of color U.S. congressional representative and the namesake for Title IX, Mink served two sets of terms in the House of Representatives. From 1965 to 1977, Mink advocated for Great Society legislation to promote federal responsibility in ameliorating class, racial, gender, and educational inequalities. When Mink returned to Congress from 1990 to 2002, the year she passed away, she faced the challenges of protecting welfare legislation that she helped pass under the Democratic Johnson administration and subsequently became subject to attack under the Democratic Clinton administration.  This presentation examines how a Japanese American woman from Hawaii, a state dominated by the Democratic Party since the mid-1950s, navigated the changing political landscape increasingly characterized by neoliberalism. While representations of Asian Americans tended to focus on their presumed model minority status to justify the existing racial and economic status quo, Mink collaborated closely with a feminist coalition of women of color, anti-poverty, and labor activists to revive and reinterpret the role of the federal state. These collaborations were crucial for the passage of social legislation in the 1960s and 1970s. A focus on the efforts to save welfare reveals how these relationships evolved into the 1990s. In essence, this presentation examines the efforts to ameliorate(in)equalities by foregrounding historical actors traditionally left out of scholarly accounts and analyzing their ideas of governance and social justice.</p>","Patsy Mink And Welfare Reform:  Race, Gender, And Resistance"

This film tells the story of a wealthy Mexican American woman who falls in love with an Argentine swimmer whom she meets at the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The paper focuses on three issues: (1) how the film counters notions of ethnic Mexicans in the 1930s as being solely poor laborers; (2) how it deals with class tensions in the Latinx community by making the swimmer character working class; and, (3) how it reveals Novarros gay desire—he was having an affair with the actor who played the male love interest, José Carabello, and thus the film is about his wish fulfillment and the female lead can be viewed as his surrogate. The film marked a turning point for Novarro, who, with the advent of talkies and the waning of the Latin lover in U.S. films, had to recalibrate his career. This project led to making a movie in Mexico, and upon his return he played Latinos—which, ironically, he had never done on American screens. The film reflects and represents a different side of Latinx Los Angeles in this era; one that helps us rethink how race, class, and sexuality functioned in this time and place. It also reveals how Novarro performed these identities on and off the screen.</p>","Performing Race, Class, And Sexuality In Depression-Era Latinx Los Angeles: An Examination Of Ramón Novarros 1936 Film Contra La Corriente"

While there have beenmany strong works that have assessed the qualities of a uniquely American Western identity, fewer studies have examined the ways in whichthis identity was present in travel narratives. This paper explores the congruities of anti-Indian discourse across two centuries and threemodes of transportation through a lens of settler colonialism in order to highlight the ways in which travel narratives upheld and contributedto mythologies of the American West. I argue that settlers participating in the overland trail migrations of the mid-nineteenth century wereinfluenced by earlier forms of forced or voluntary travel narratives and, in turn, settler narratives were highly influential to later travelnarratives of overland rail passengers and early automobile clubs—specifically in how these narratives described Native people andspaces. Ultimately, this discourse upheld and contributed to an evolving pioneer mythology—one steeped in white supremacy—that wasrepresentative of a settler colonial ideology and one that continues to permeate contemporary American social and cultural consciousness.</p>","Plains, Trains, And Automobiles: Settler Discourse In Travel Writing"

Poetry and satire on scientific topics often made its way into publications such as <i>Manufacturer and Builder</i> and the <i>Sanitarian</i>, in between articles that detailed the most recent scientific and medical discoveries. The perils of improper plumbing appeared in verse, and technology-savvy humorists satirized laborers encounters with industrial technology. Scientific topics also made their way into the columns of popular journals such as <i>Harpers Weekly and Godeys Ladys Book</i>, where the authors were primarily popular poets and humorists rather than scientists and physicians.  Despite the difference in authors, these poems covered similar topics and were widely reprinted, disseminating discoveries and recommending new behaviors to the middle-class audiences of these publications.This paper argues that poems and satire popularized science through their very form. Simple meter and rhyme facilitated memorization and recitation, and punchlines explained technological marvels. Poetry and satire, like formal articles, was also a space for debate: dissenters responded in kind, challenging new knowledge through reference to the efficacy of traditional methods.  By following discussions of new knowledge through the humor of trade and popular journals, we can see how scientific knowledge entered high-brow and low-brow culture by appealing to existent practices, eliciting laughs, and employing dialectic.</p>","Poetic Plumbing And Laughable Labor: Humorous Lessons In New Technology"

In this paper, I probe police departments handling of the movement by raising an entirely different set of questions. What did police officials say about civil rights activists when they were communicating among themselves in their own publications? What language did they use to describe civil rights activism? And which aspects of the movement did they describe as permissible, and which as criminal? First, police almost exclusively focused on protests and demonstrations, virtually ignoring the wide breadth of civil rights activism that included meetings, petitions, media appearances, and lawsuits. Second, police frequently engaged in a misleading both sides discourse that treated civil rights activists and white supremacists such as the White Citizens Council as ideologically counterbalanced adversaries who operated at equal distances from a reasonable political center. Third, police publications regularly mentioned civil rights demonstrators and rioters in the same paragraph, if not the same sentence. Even when they claimed to draw a contrast between legal protest and illegal destruction of property, law enforcement writings often suggested a correlation between the two. By scrutinizing the discursive patterns of law enforcement publications on civil rights activism, this paper seeks to reveal a different set of insights into police-movement relations than what examinations of protest control and surveillance have produced.</p>","Police On The Movement: What Cops Said About Civil Rights"

Both men were in their early twenties, active members of the Chicano movement in Albuquerque as well as the Black Berets (the New Mexico offshoot of the Brown Berets), and had committed themselves to opposing police brutality. When they attempted to break into a dynamite shed at a construction site, a contingent of law enforcement officers from multiple police agencies awaited and killed the two men. The circumstances of the killings were as conflicted as they were complex. So was the aftermath. Spurred by massive protests organized by the Black Berets, which included a broad swath of Burqueños, the city and state governments developed reforms that rebuilt trust between law enforcement and the Mexican American community and revised police procedures in a number of important ways.This paper examines this conflicted and complex history. I argue that the gross illegalities committed by the police who killed Canales and Cordova exposed the problematic nature of southwestern policing in ways that few New Mexicans outside of the Mexican American community understood. That exposure as well as the agency and activism of the Chicano movement in New Mexico forced law enforcement to inaugurate reforms. These reforms served as a way of saving face for police, but they were also supported by a number of police officials, especially Albuquerque police chief, Donald Byrd, who forthrightly believed that reforming the police was good for the city and state.</p>","Police Slay Two Berets: How The Police Killings Of Antonio Cordova And Rito Canales Spurred Criminal Justice Reform In New Mexico"

Not until after Fort Worth residents narrowly voted to create single-member districts in 1975 did Fort Worth see its first Latino city council member with the election of Louis Zapata in 1977 at a time when Latinos (primarily of Mexican descent) made up nearly 13 percent of the citys population. Moreover, between 1977 and 2017, Fort Worths Mexican population increased by 600 percent, growing from just under 50,000 to nearly 300,000 over a 40-year span, making up approximately 35 percent of Fort Worths total population as we move further into the twenty-first century. Even with this tremendous growth, never have Mexicans held more than one seat on the nine-member city council, and for nearly a third of that 40-year period Mexicans were not represented whatsoever. This paper explains how Mexicans were successful in gaining political representation in the Fort Worth City Council during the 1970s, only to lose that representation in the 1990s despite their rapid population upsurge. In exploring the causes of this collapse in power and step backward in Mexican struggles for equal representation, this research dissects power struggles among Mexicans, Euro-Americans, and African Americans as well as internal struggles among Fort Worths Mexican community leaders.</p>","Population Gained And Power Lost: Unequal Mexican Representation In Fort Worth, Texas"

A discourse of N/native disappearance served as the justification; as scientists and National Park Service personnel were anxious about two kinds of so-called vanishing natives—one human (Native Hawaiians) and the other nonhuman (native flora and fauna). Positioning itself as the savior of these N/natives, the Park Service swallowed increasingly more land to create a tourist wonderland and what it believed to be a refuge for Native Hawaiian culture and native species. My talk discusses the land-grabbing and knowledge-making projects of the Park Service in Hawaii during this era to argue that the Park Service was a settler colonial force central to Native Hawaiian dispossession and elimination, and the commodification of Native culture and species. Central to these processes was the settler understanding of Hawaiian nature and Hawaiian culture as separate, static entities. Native Hawaiian culture was not allowed to change; and neither were native species—and both required the removal of indigenous people. I focus on two case studies: Park Service efforts to restore the nēnē (Hawaiian goose) through forest acquisitions; and the anthropological work of Native Hawaiian surveyor Henry Kekahuna, who interpreted cultural sites in the newly acquired areas of Hawaii National Park. The resistances of the nēnē and Kekahuna suggest alternatives to the way we might understand and approach preservation work going forward, perhaps cherishing more dynamic forms of living and collaboration.</p>","Preserving N/Natives: Native Species Restoration And Salvage Anthropology In Hawaii National Park, 1940s–50s"

Long before rape and sexual assault became a national and international policy issue in the wake of the 1991 Navy Tailhook scandal, military officials struggled to define sexual assault and implement policies to prevent it.  In fact, the scarcity of official service policies on sexual assault during the Cold War suggest that military leaders did not view sexual assault as an institutional problem in need of sustained and systematic intervention.  To the contrary, leaders assumed that sexual violence was a natural consequence of military service, especially in remote locations and war zones.  Consequently, official policies implemented before the turn of the century were often reactive and situational, rather than preventative and systematically implemented.  Although the Uniform Code of Military Justice, adopted in 1950, provided uniform definitions of sexual assault that were applicable to all service branches, legal officials varying interpretations of what constituted Article 120 and 125 violations at courts-martial undermined efforts to streamline the prosecution of perpetrators.  Mapping the militarys historic policies and practices related to sexual violence is critical for contextualizing current policy debates and offering effective solutions.  Though the challenges researchers will face given the sensitive nature of the subject and the paucity of sources are daunting, this work has far-reaching implications for improving social justice and the future of military efforts to manage sexual violence.</p>","Problematic Policies &Amp; Far-Reaching Consequences: Historicizing Sexual Violence In The American Military"

These intermediaries had stranded thousands of African American, Puerto Rican, and transnational migrants from the Americas who came North to labor as domestic workers. Upon arrival, women and girls found that agents (and advertisers) had misrepresented the jobs, held their baggage hostage, and deducted from paychecks hidden charges, leaving them with a pittance. Confined to workplaces that served as their living quarters, indebted to intermediaries who facilitation their travel and job placement, these midcentury migrant domestic workers were not the first to hover between freedom and unfreedom. Commodified reproductive labor long has existed in such a twilight zone: servants, maids, and household workers have found themselves liable to labor contracts, neither free or unfree, isolated from other workers or larger communities. This paper traces legal constructions as well as worker conditions during the mid-20th century. To consider the struggle against for-profit agencies as conduits for exploitation and trafficking, I move between scales of regulation between the local (New York City), the state (New York State) and federal (Labor Department restrictions on visa for live-in foreign maids) to chart protection of migrating workers.

Specifically, the paper examines the evolution of policies regulating state and local taxation, bonded indebtedness, municipal incorporation, and municipal annexation. A host of Progressive Era education reforms—from administrative centralization to the creation of school playgrounds—were profoundly shaped by these policies. Yet, historians have rarely considered their impact on education reform during the Progressive Era. This paper contends that state public finance policies encouraged, often by design, competition between communities over financial resources for education reforms and a narrow view of the purposes of Progressive Era public schooling. These policies, in turn, created new disparities between school districts and new forms of inequality in the region. The paper argues that incorporating a concern for public finance policies into histories of Progressive Era education reform allows us to better understand the history of educational inequality and the states role in shaping it. The paper draws on state and local financial and legal documents, newspaper accounts, legislative records, the personal papers of lawmakers, and digitized financial data. Following the insights of postwar metropolitan historians, the paper places a mixture of urban, suburban, and rural communities in the same analytic space. In doing so, the paper brings into view disparities between school districts too easily missed by isolated studies of urban schools or broader state and national syntheses during the Progressive Era.</p>","Public Finance, State-Sponsored Inequalities, And The Race For Progressive Era Education Reform In Northern California"

In particular, this paper will explore how an analysis of ongoing U.S. colonial rule in Puerto Rico and the punitive regimes that it has both imposed and facilitated in the archipelago complicate the current historiographic approach to the geography and temporality of the U.S. carceral state. Ultimately, this contribution argues for a more expansive and transnational understanding of the U.S. carceral state, which is made possible through the inclusion of Puerto Rico as a key site for American regimes of race making, capitalist development, and punitive power.</p>","Puerto Rico And The History Of The Carceral State"

Yet, as the historiography of HIV/AIDS in the Americas remains primarily centered on the labor of U.S.-based activists and actors, the stories and lives of Black Caribbeans in general, and queer Caribbeans in particular, have been largely left out of narratives of HIV/AIDS research, organizing, and care. Using Jamaica as a case study to explore how race, blackness, and queer sexuality function in historical accounts of the epidemic reveals the bidirectional flows of HIV/AIDS activism in the late 1990s to early 2000s.  Through my prolonged engagements with the contemporary experiences of HIV-positive young women using oral historical interviews and feminist ethnography,  I illustrate how they helped form feminist and queer counterpublics that contest sexual respectability, class oppression, and colonial legacies.  In doing so, my archive responds to Omiseeke Natasha Tinsleys poignant question: What else can black women desire besides what the archive documents?

As author of The Negro Family: The Case for National Action in 1965, Moynihan had stirred up considerable controversy on questions of poverty and social justice, and spent a considerable part of his political career working on Social Security and welfare issues. In this paper I analyze his role in forming congressional responses to the AIDS crisis in the light of his broader interest in welfare reform. I begin by examining his work on Social Security reform in the early 1980s, deploying a queer reading of the deserving/undeserving tropes used in the reform debates, before looking at how he brought the assumptions of liberal social policy into his efforts to secure health and welfare coverage for people with AIDS. I argue that liberal policy making often used similar ideological arguments about sexuality that informed their assumptions about race and poverty twenty years earlier.</p>","Queering The Welfare Queen: Daniel Patrick Moynihan, The Democratic Party, And The Hiv/Aids Crisis In The 1980s"

Her optimism reflected the uptick in cooperation between the Freeze movement, the largest antinuclear group in the United States, and civil rights leadership who identified antinuclear sentiment as a vital ingredient in the New Coalition of Conscious. Collaboration between the antinuclear and civil rights movements made up the moral core of the New Coalition of Conscious, which keyed the success of the twentieth-anniversary commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr.s March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The name of the commemorative demonstration reflected the emergence of this new coalition, and the March on Washington for Jobs, Peace, and Freedom in August 1983 exceeded the size of the original event. In highlighting events such as this 20th anniversary celebration, this paper examines how the antinuclear movement appealed to minority communities by illuminating how the modernization of the U.S. nuclear arsenal distorted the national economy and curtailed job opportunities and access to government resources. I argue that in prioritizing the connection between race, labor, and peace the partnership between the antinuclear movement and civil rights leaders contributed to the foundation of modern progressivism in age dominated by Ronald Reagan and the New Right.</p>","Race, Labour, And The U.S. Nuclear Economy Of The 1980s"

Although this appears to be a recent occurrence, the region has a long history of military presence dating back to the 1846–1848 U.S. Mexico War.  In the aftermath of that conflict, Washington established over a hundred military bases from Texas to California.  This new geo-political order set in motion forces that allowed African American freedwoman Cathy Williams, who impersonated a male Buffalo soldier in the late 1860s, to patrol northern New Mexico Nnēē (Apache) and Diné (Navajo) communities after the Civil War.  Concurrently in a different borderlands locale, Mexican widow Simona González de Valdéss testimony before U.S. officials detailed the raiding of her villa in Bagdad, Tamaulipas, México.  According to her, during their rampage black troops from Fort Brown, Texas, stole metals and her ropa interior (underwear).  While the lives of these women of color collided with the armed forces in distinct areas, they took place in proximity to nineteenth century military bases.  My paper offers a new understanding of early militarization by excavating the lives of specific racial and gender minorities in different borderlands locales who exploited military bases for personal gain.</p>","Racialized Identities In Militarized Spaces: Gender, Autonomy, And Texas And New Mexico's Military Forts, 1848–1877"

Nevertheless, radical black artists who had been part of this late Popular Front Left, such as Ruby Dee, Ossie Davis, John O.

They continued to publicly and strategically critique anti-communism. This paper will outline how their stance as part of black Popular Front organizations movement continued to serve the black radicals, and also how they consciously sought to articulate new positions in response to their analysis of their current moment. They continued to strategize with each other about how to promote  the black struggle, liberation, and self-determination, and how to articulate a black arts cultural nationalism. They began to imagine new forms of Negro nationalism that were anti-colonialist and might provide a framework  to drive efforts to  dismantle the systems of segregation and stop the white terrorist attacks on black lives. They also continued to explore the structural connections between white supremacy, militarism, labor exploitation, and normative gender ideals.  Finally, this paper will explore what might be gained by rethinking these positions  as  articulating a kind of black New Left formulation that deeply influenced the Left as whole during the 1960s and 1970s. </p>","Radical Black Artists Constitute A Black New Left, 1958–1964"

Telephone poles and wires crisscrossed the countryside, and buildings and design provided a corporate face that first helped make the disruptive technology acceptable, then helped make it desirable. The proliferation of art deco telephone buildings in American downtowns in the 1920s and 1930s marked the peak of this confident and exuberant public architecture for private infrastructure. In the postwar decades, however, this infrastructure was no longer new and began to require the less appealing investments for maintenance. As American downtowns began to empty due to white flight, once-proud institutional landmarks became defensive and battered liabilities. AT&Ts attempts to craft a corporate policy surrounding the urban crisis centered in part on fear of its offices becoming targets for civil rights demonstrations in Chicago, Detroit, and other cities by the late 1960s. This defensive posture produced an attitude of indifference to design and overt hostility to the urban environment. As real estate became risk, buildings that once welcomed the public in open houses and public offices turned inward providing a stark material symbol of the waning monopolys changing status in the American city.</p>","Real Estate And Risk: Telephone Buildings In The Age Of The Urban Crisis "

These women unseated deeply entrenched incumbents, including in some cases&nbsp;their own husbands. The all-male city council remained in power, however, and set itself against the new officeholders. Eventually, the states attorney general and its high courts were involved in determining the legitimacy of the mayoress and other town officials. The story became a national media sensation, sparking public debates that offer rich insight into contemporary ideas about gender, family, politics, and even regional identity. However, the story has received little scholarly attention, in part due to apparent efforts by subsequent Hunnewell governments to expunge it from the towns history. This paper contextualizes the Hunnewell story within a broader historiography on female officeholders in the years before the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. Examining newspaper reports and court documents, it also ruminates on the surprising gaps in the archival record, to offer new insights into Progressive womens political successes and their challenges—not only in terms of governing but also in terms of being duly remembered.</p>","Recalling The Mayoress: Power, Politics, And Historical Memory In Hunnewell, Kansas (1911)"

Cheyenne people have visited this site to pray, fast, and conduct national ceremonies for centuries. After Lt. Col. Armstrong Custers expedition discovered gold in the Black Hills in 1874, however, life changed dramatically for Cheyenne people. By 1877, federal officials had ended Cheyenne treaty rights to the Black Hills and began the process of removing the Cheyenne living in the northern plains to Oklahoma. While these actions affected every facet of Cheyenne lifeways, this paper focuses on the effects on Cheyenne peoples ability to maintain the primacy of their relationship to Bear Butte. The barriers Cheyenne people experienced when attempting to access this sacred space severely restricted full practice of Cheyenne religion. Yet over the past one hundred and fifty years, Cheyenne people continued to travel to Bear Butte for ceremonies despite removal and the restrictions of reservation life. Since the end of World War II, Cheyenne people have begun to use new tools in their efforts to reclaim the mountain as sacred space and to gain recognition of this connection by nonnatives. This paper delineates Cheyenne efforts to continue to travel to Bear Butte during the most restrictive moments of the reservation period. It then explores the relationships Cheyenne people built between land owners and later the park service to retain their connection to the land. It argues that Cheyenne have used methods as varied as building relationships with landowners and park rangers, protesting development, and purchasing land to retain, rejuvenate, and protect their relationship to their sacred mountain, Noaha-vose. It posits that by engaging on multiple levels with the settlers who now inhabit the area, Cheyenne people have continued to remake their relationship with the land, ensuring their presence in their sacred landscape by challenging the inequalities of settler colonialism that have tried to erase it.</p>","Reclaiming Noaha-Vose (Bear Butte): Cheyenne Resistance To Settler Colonialism In A Sacred Place"

I will also discuss my work conducting and analyzing over sixty oral history interviews of Mexican American and black residents in Oxnard. These perspectives had been all but omitted in the publicly available primary sources. For this study, oral accounts and personal collections were integral to revealing four strategies of segregation deployed concurrently over four decades: 1) establishing a racial hierarchy, 2) building a permanent link between residential and school segregation, 3) utilizing a school-within-a-school model of racial separation, and 4) omitting a rationale for segregation. These strategies complicate previous narratives, which tend to focus exclusively either on schools or housing, in black and white, urban and suburban communities.

Robert James, an African American cook from Little Rock, Arkansas, spoke with Samuel S. Taylor, an employee of the Works Progress Administrations Federal Writers Project. James shared stories that his family had shared with him about their lives as slaves in the American South before emancipation. One of those stories described the experience of Jamess mother during the Civil War. I heard my mother say that her master and them had to refugee them to keep them from the Yankees, James recalled. She told a ghost tale on that. I guess it must have been true. At the same time that James described his mothers Civil War refugee ghost story, political and legal officials in the United States and around the world engaged in discussions about the responsibility of nation-states to harbor refugees fleeing persecution. After the end of World War II, those discussions began turning into domestic law and internationally codified agreements concerning refugees—most notably, the Displaced Persons Act, passed in the United States in 1948, and the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention. These domestic and international policies defined refugees as people who have been persecuted or who fear persecution and have crossed an international border in search of protection. This newly codified association of international migration with the recognition of particular persecuted people as refugees had the effect of exorcising some stories of dispossession and displacement from the historical memory of the United States as a place of refuge. As Jamess story about his mother reminds us, people who may not typically be remembered as refugees in American history—including slaves—have nevertheless been refugees in their lived experience and in their memory, even if they have not always been recognized as refugees by law and in political status. Using interviews with African Americans and Native Americans who participated in the Works Progress Administrations Federal Writers Project as a point of departure, this paper engages the 2020 OAH theme of (in)equalities by exploring the gap between individual experiences of being a refugee and the laws narrowly defined conception of who is—and who is not—a refugee. Following the lead of African Americans and Native Americans who shared memories of their ancestors experiences as refugees during the Civil War with WPA workers, the paper compares efforts that U.S. officials undertook to shelter refugee slaves and native refugees during the Civil War to emerging definitions of refugee in the mid-20th century. In doing so, it 1) interrogates the underlying inequalities that inform refugee recognition; 2) shows how the focus of U.S. refugee law on internationally displaced and persecuted people after World War II elides distinctly American histories of displacement and persecution within U.S. borders; and 3) works toward a retelling of U.S. refugee history committed to considering how the legacy of the nations foundational inequalities—settler colonialism and slavery—haunt U.S. refugee law and the countrys legacy as a place of refuge.</p>","Remembering Refugees: Memory, Law, And The Inequalities Of Refugee Recognition In U.S. History"

Some important features of reform movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States were the involvement of middle-class, educated American women and their aim to Americanize immigrants, especially those from eastern and southern Europe and Asia. American female activists were in contact with immigrant women who were the object of the reform as well as important actors of reform activities in their communities. However, not many studies reveal how American female activists were related to immigrants and how their activities eventually led to other labor, womens, and peace movements with increasingly national and global networks. This paper examines Balchs works and reports on her activities and fieldwork in Slavic (immigrant) communities in host and home countries, in addition to her commitment to support wartime refugees from Europe and Japanese Americans in internment camps. Further, it attempts to reveal how womens social movements contributed to forming images of racial, national, and ethnic boundaries and fixed gender roles for minority groups. It also shows how Balchs experiences and human relationships helped her imagine a global network of women for peace.</p>","Representation Of Immigrants And Their Gender Roles: Emily Greene Balch And Her Social Work In The Early 20th-Century United States"

How did the social, political, and economic effort of fighting the war transform into the demobilization of peacetime? This shift was not easy, particularly as the war created new social-movement energies, including among women war workers and African American soldiers. This paper will look at informal and institutionalized efforts to help demobilized soldiers become police officers at the end of World War II in the United States as a way to kill two birds with one stone. Faced with a labor surplus and growing social and economic discontent in the immediate aftermath of the wars end in 1945, federal as well as municipal officials sought to streamline the hiring process to enable returning soldiers to become cops. This process enhanced the repressive capacities of the state, while closing off avenues of discontent and social movement participation for some returning veterans. Even as the G.I. Bill is considered a landmark piece of legislation in creating the conditions for urban and suburban social transformation and economic prosperity in the postwar period, scholars have not adequately examined the way police forces grew as a means of controlling labor and antiracist organizing. Both white and African American veterans became police, as I detail.

The white woman, a divorced mother of five children, contested her legal standing of incompetency.  She sought to establish her capacity. In support of her case, a local storekeeper testified that Hacker bought goods always independently and carefully, not getting unnecessary things. U.S. democracy is built on the premise that citizens have capacity, and such is the foundation for equality claims.  Since the founding of the nation, however, eligibility to claim the mantle of citizenship and its accompanying rights has been debated vehemently. Courts and legislatures have used factors such as race, ethnicity, property ownership, gender, physical or intellectual ability, age, education, and criminal history to determine capacity for rights. Numerous scholars have examined the historical expansion of democracy, rights, and civic fitness.    This paper counters and enriches current historiography by instead examining adults determined legally unfit. Specifically, I examine adults who contested a prior legal determination of their incompetency and thus made explicit claims about their civic capacity. Across the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, the management of money and other property in ways considered gender, age, and racially appropriate served as a primary criterion. Analyses of contested incompetency deepen contemporary and historical understandings of how inequalities are created via varying access to rights, and they reveal the often-hidden relationship between embodiment/body-mindedness and rights.   </p>","Resisting Incompetence: Adults Under Guardianship And The Claiming Of Capacity"

Many studies have emphasized the solidarity among minorities as one of the significant factors that aided the enactment of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (CLA), providing a national apology and restitution of $20,000 to each surviving citizen and resident alien of Japanese ancestry who had been interned during World War II. Japanese American redress activists sought support from outside the Japanese American community to show members of Congress that the redress was an issue for not only Japanese Americans but all Americans. However, remaining unexamined across historical studies of the redress movement is the multiplicity and dynamics of individual minority groups. There is a gap in the history of the Japanese American redress movement studies. While studies have emphasized the solidarity between Japanese Americans and other minorities, much less work has been done on other minorities specific perspectives on the redress movement. To begin to fill this gap, this presentation focuses on African American attitudes toward the redress movement. As this presentation shows, one African American scholars reaction to the CLA was, Why them and not me? This presentation will argue that the African American communitys attitude in general was ambivalent. Further, considering the history of the African American reparations movement, the presentation will show that African American activists have struggled to make strategic use of the Japanese American redress movement.</p>","Rethinking Redress: African American Perspectives On The Japanese American Reparations Movement"

Social scientists and policy makers devoted enormous attention to racial inequality, segregation, and ghettos from the 1940s into the 1970s, as the civil rights and black power movements confronted racial inequality in the United States. As scholars strove to understand Americas combustible race relations, simulation games generated enormous enthusiasm among many social scientists and educators, who believed that these games enabled both scholars and students to model social problems, understand them more intuitively, and explore possible solutions to them. Proponents believed that gaming, unlike textbooks and lectures, offered a dynamic and interactive learning experience that permitted students to engage in role-playing and understand the gestalt of a social problem. The simulation games Ghetto, created by social worker Dove Toll and the Johns Hopkins Game Program in 1969, and Blacks & Whites, devised by two professors of psychology and the magazine Psychology Today in 1970, sought to provide players a vicarious experience of the hardships endured by black Americans—poverty, racial discrimination, and residential segregation. These simulation games sought to reveal to players the near impossibility of keeping ones head above water when ones income remained below the poverty line. The games designers believed that these simulations would cause players to recognize the difficulty of climbing out of poverty, give players a better understanding of poverty and race relations, and imbue them with more empathy for the poor. Both Ghetto and Blacks & Whites focused principally on the lack of sufficient income and residential segregation that afflicted black Americans. Ghettos rules and structure emphasized that poor blacks lacked the economic resources to propel themselves out of poverty or improve conditions in the ghetto, while Blacks & Whites encouraged role-play, empathy, and focused on residential segregation. Modeling economic inequality and residential segregation was comparatively straightforward, but modeling racism and racial discrimination proved much more elusive. Ghetto and Blacks & Whites arose from social scientists effort to understand race relations in the 1960s, but these board games could hardly capture the gestalt of ghetto life or gauge the pervasiveness and irrationality of American racism.</p>","Role-Playing, Poverty, And Race In The Simulation Games Ghetto And Blacks & Whites"

Race, Religion, And Purity In The 20th Century</h5></p><p>As Protestant clergy advocated for contraceptive access for married women in the years immediately following World War II, they found themselves navigating political waters complicated by two issues: eugenics and sexual morality. The early years of the birth control movement had been characterized by its growing connection with the eugenics movement, a relationship actively pursued by Margaret Sanger for political reasons. But in the aftermath of the Holocaust and during the nascent civil rights movement, these leaders were no longer comfortable with the eugenic implications of contraceptive campaigns. Simultaneously, they also found themselves needing to refute the claim that access to contraception would result in unmarried women having sex—opponents of contraception essentially claimed that fear of pregnancy was what kept good girls good. In sidestepping both of these objections to contraception, liberal clergy depended on the far older concept of purity. Rather than talking about what racial groups should (or should not) reproduce, they instead focused on the ideals of sexual love in marriage—using religious language to underscore the sacrality of marital love and the decision of whether and when to have children as an important place for individual moral decisions. Protestants referred to this intersection of sexual love and the prayerful decision to parent as responsible parenthood, and while they rarely invoked the specific language of purity, the language of responsible parenthood echoed its tropes. In an important shift for the birth control movement, eugenics became unacceptable because of the states violation of the sanctity of a couples marriage bed. Clergy wanted instead to focus on upholding couples moral agency in deciding how to structure their families. This language of sacrality stood in, in these moments, for purity—sex was sacred if it was pure of intent, as it should be in true Christian marriage. This return to the language of purity in the postwar marriage bed echoed old ideas, but also did much to contribute to the new postwar idea of familial privacy and the receding of state power. That said, at the same time that the language of purity pushed against formal, state-sponsored eugenics programs, the perfect, morally pure nuclear family envisioned by these leaders modeled certain middle- and upper-class white norms—and provided a rhetoric that echoed through the state as it attempted to shape working class and nonwhite families into acceptable, pure and purely American family structures.</p>","Sacrality And Purity In The Mid-Century Push For Contraception"

Because the program came into existence amid the civil rights movement, numerous cases of police brutality, and over 200 race riots in postindustrial cities, the yearly Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) grant from the federal government offered to cities under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 appealed to liberal and conservative politicians alike. Many conservative city officials often conflated civil rights protestors, rioters, social activists, and gang members into a single entity that was a constant nuisance to the police. Additionally, President Lyndon B. Johnsons Great Society programs, War on Poverty, and War on Crime led liberals and conservatives to debate how to reduce crime with the LEAA grant. Conservatives argued police departments should receive the grant funds to spend on strengthening its crime-fighting methods. Liberals lobbied for the funds to finance local social-uplift programs that would gradually rectify the issue of urban poverty and reduce crime. Although the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, 1965, and 1968 federally enforced desegregation and equal opportunity employment, voting, and housing, respectively, several conservative politicians such as like Mayor Frank L. Rizz) refused to believed that curing the social ills of poverty, unemployment, and school dropouts would dramatically reduce crime in major cities such as Philadelphia. From 1969 to 1976, Specter competed with Mayor Rizzo for funding to rehabilitate youth at Safe Streets, Inc., centers in the predominantly black neighborhoods of North and West Philadelphia, while Rizzo proposed to utilize the grant to strengthen police crime-fighting techniques. The battle over federal funding between liberal and conservative politicians influenced police-community relations in the 1970s when violence between police and citizens in Philadelphia was at its highest since 1930.</p>","Safe Streets, Inc.: The Hustle To End Black Gang Violence In Philadelphia, 1969–1976"

Salvage tourism is tied to nonnative attempts to salvage native cultures before they supposedly degenerate from stereotypical ideals of a pristine Indian past. It builds on ideas of a nostalgic past through the nation-building practices of tourism and the creation of a distinctly American identity. This allows tourists to find sanctuary, safety, and security in performances of misremembered pasts.

Johnson discussed the War on Poverty with his advisors, he implored, This is going to be an education program. We are going to eliminate poverty through education… people are going to learn their way out of poverty. While the idea of schooling ones way out of poverty was not new to the era—indeed it had a storied history in the United States—the postwar incarnation of this idea had a more recent and unexpected model: Puerto Rico. As a self-described showcase of democracy in the Caribbean, a model for United States-style development for the Third World, and a handy foil to Soviet-backed Cuba following the 1959 Revolution, Puerto Rico played a key if oft-forgotten role in the development of U.S. foreign and domestic policy. It was also a colony of the United States.This paper examines links between economic policies in the U.S. and Puerto Rico from the 1940s to the mid-1960s, considering how the islands development program Operation Bootstrap served as inspiration for aid programs abroad—particularly the Alliance for Progress—before circulating home to the Great Society. In particular, I emphasize the strategic role education played as the only valid passport from poverty first in the context of rising Cold War nationalisms and then domestically when racialized poverty and black nationalism posed similar threats to the capitalist system. Conversing with recent scholarship that engages links between the politics of capitalism and the politics of U.S. imperialism, I place schooling at the center of that story. </p>","Schooling For Global Capitalism In The Oldest Colony In The World:  The Puerto Rican Origins Of The Educational War On Poverty"

Hoffa offered a precursor to the current political landscape. Despite a series of high profile investigations, criminal indictments, and prosecutions that included many of his Hoffas closest associates, his working-class supporters remained loyal to him, shrugging aside the mounting evidence of his corruption or blandly discounting the significance of any corrupt acts in which he might have engaged. For his part, Hoffa claimed the investigations amounted to nothing more than persecution by his elitist, liberal opponents, supported by a corrupt news media. At rallies, he mocked and denounced these opponents, to the delight of his supporters. His taunting defiance kept him in the spotlight, where front-page news articles profiled his willingness to defy the political conventions of the day. Liberal commentators responded to Hoffas popularity by raising questions about the values of the working class and about its changing position in American society. In this earlier era, those questions tended to focus on one particular segment of the working-class: truck drivers, a group with whom Hoffa was firmly identified. This paper will explore the nature of that link by analyzing the media accounts of the Hoffa phenomenon, as well as the recurring fictionalized depictions of it in TV and film. While Hoffas biographers have taken the truckers loyalty as a given, this paper will explore how media reports framed it and linked it to larger conclusions about the American working class.</p>","Searching For Jimmy Hoffa:  Truckers And The Precursor To The Trump Phenomenon"

However, historians have often overlooked the extent to which South African policymakers engaged with anticommunist politics to legitimize apartheid and establish white settler rule. The framing of the National partys domestic and foreign policies in the 1940s and 1950s make clear the extent to which anticommunism was bound up with white supremacy at this historical moment. Anticommunism was used as a political facade to secure investment and trade, and to deflect international criticism of the apartheid system.

The topic seemed to suggest itself. The debate over artificial birth control in 1968 had moved conscience language to the center of public discourses about sexual morality. The simultaneous rise of selective conscientious objection to the Vietnam War, conference planner William Bier noted, made conscience central to civic life as well. In the 1960s, a dual crisis in the Catholic Church (over birth control) and American society (over the Vietnam War) brought Catholics to converge on conscience, a concept they thought heralded a bright future for church and nation.An initial confluence of debates about war and sex blended into one another almost immediately. In the winter of 1973, after the Supreme Court struck down state laws restricting abortions, Catholics transferred the concept of conscience immediately from anti-conscription debates to the anti-abortion movement. Father James McHugh, a high-ranking bureaucrat at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, wrote a memo in the spring of 1973 arguing that the failure to protect conscience during the draft proved that conscience rights must be vigorously and clearly asserted in response to the legalization of abortion.American historians often treat the sexual revolution and the anti-war movement as separate affairs, but Americans experienced the two as of a piece. This paper demonstrates that conscience protections have their origins in a two-sided crisis: the coercion of bodies for certain ends in sexuality and in war. </p>","Sex, War, And Conscience: The Catholic Church And The Rise Of Conscience Protections"

Many helped underwrite the sale of bondspeople, using them as a kind of capital. They accepted enslaved people as collateral for loans and as a part of loans assigned over to them from third parties. And they were willing to sell the enslaved as part of foreclosure proceedings on anyone who failed to fulfill a debt contract. Yet bondspeople who had been part of the property brought into a marriage, or who had been placed in trust for a wife, proved to be particularly problematic for creditors such as banks. During foreclosure proceedings, wives (especially widows) often claimed ignorance of their husbands financial dealings with banks, and sought to prevent the seizure of enslaved people. While courts almost always viewed this as a clear case of fraud against the bank (putting slave property up as collateral upon whom the debtor did not have full legal title), they often also viewed the wife as an unwilling victim of the husbands misdeeds. Banks thus needed to prove not only that the husband had acted fraudulently, but also that the wife had knowingly participated in the fraud. Or, they had to prove that the (usually now-deceased) husband had not acted in bad faith, but that rather the wifes assertion of a prior claim on the bondspeople was fraudulent. The courts moral concern for the impact of these loan contracts on financial dependents ignored altogether the fate of those for whom these decisions mattered most—the slaves themselves.</p>","Slaves, Banks, And Married Womens Property Rights"

Through its labor strikes and consumer boycott, the UFW movement has also been credited with playing a catalyzing role in the early Chicano movement, and has since served as a shorthand for Chicanx/Latinx legibility within an overarching framework of American social movements. This paper will pivot away from this narrative and foreground the Filipino farm workers who first initiated the Delano Grape Strike in 1965 and who continued to play central roles in the UFWs history in the 1970s. For them, the UFW movement represented a way to improve their material conditions and to rectify the continuing legacies of racial violence and colonial dispossession. More contentiously, some Filipino leaders argued that participation in the labor movement offered strikers psychological emancipation from past marginalization, whether experienced in the United States or in the Philippines. Lastly, many Filipino UFW members would spend the late 1970s publicizing their contributions to a now-iconic movement. Their continued erasure in our historiographies and popular culture compels us to reflect on the hidden layers of inequality in seemingly egalitarian social movements.</p>","Soldiers Of The Soil: On The Filipino History Of The United Farm Worker Movement"

In the four decades after the Civil War, the Pension Bureau performed millions of medical examinations on Union veterans. Like their white, northern counterparts, tens of thousands of black veterans, in order to secure military pensions, had to submit to periodic medical examinations before a board of three federally deputized surgeons. After an extensive and intensive process, these boards would rate the claimants level of disability on a scale of sixteenths, to be matched to a corresponding rate of pension for the successful claimant. Deploying the latest biomedical knowledge and technologies, these examinations embodied for many the newly professionalized, technocratic administrative state. But the import of these examinations has not been fully appreciated, much less so how formerly enslaved men—as yet in the penumbra of slavery—engaged these examining boards.This paper will argue that medical examinations for pensions were a central arena of struggle for formerly enslaved men in the South. In an era when citizenship was premised in part on moral and physical fitness, how was it that tens of thousands of formerly enslaved men and women earned the fruits of citizenship precisely by virtue of their disability and dependency? Using case files, government documents, and newspapers, this paper explores how African Americans negotiated their examinations and, in turn, their citizenship.</p>","Some Measure Of Justice: American Americans And The Biomedical State"

In 1958, 30 percent of the pensions $1.1 billion in assets, set aside to provide retirement security to state workers, was invested in state and local bonds. Then Levitt began to divest. By 1967, local securities made up less than 2 percent of pension assets, replaced with corporate stocks and bonds, 35 percent of the states now $2.7 billion portfolio.  In orchestrating this transition, Levitt, a Democrat, shifted the pension system away from its longstanding fiscal support of the local ambitions of postwar liberalism. State workers and local governments, formerly bound in a relationship of fiscal support, were now equally dependent on financial markets, with broadly divergent outcomes. Entrusted to the financial instruments of corporate capitalism, pension yields for a time went up. So did local bond rates, as municipalities experienced the full weight of market discipline. So far, the story of the rise of finance in the United States has been a federal story, told in conjunction with the fall of the New Deal order during the pivotal decade of the 1970s. States, meanwhile, have been left out of the narrative. The experience of New Yorks pension system reveals, however, that state policy makers turned to finance sooner and trusted in markets earlier than scholars of financialization have recognized.

The paper contextualizes Hurstons work by tracing the history of female folklorists collecting black and native peoples songs across the Northeast, the Midwest, and the global South from their origins in the nineteenth century to the government-funded projects of the 1930s. It argues that accessing their history is essential to understanding the Works Project Administrations attempts to crown and conserve indigenous American art forms through the lens of folklore.

The model they pioneered—which permitted the creation of staggeringly complex, far-flung supply chains that produced standard parts—is now the dominant method of organizing mass production.</p>","Standard Parts: The Death Of Fordism And The Rise Of Flexible Production"

Starting from the writings of U.S. engineers such as William Barclay Parsons (founder of Parsons-Brinckerhoff, the multinational engineering firm responsible for Bostons Big Dig) as much as those of money doctors, the paper will illustrate how these two standardization questions shared common contexts in a shifting landscape of infrastructure imperialism and development. In late Qing and early Republican China, for instance, were neoimperial interests—British, French, German, Japanese, Russian, and U.S.—best served by carving up territorial-commercial spheres of interest premised on differing technical standards or by adopting common formats to integrate markets based on a joint regime of investment and debt? In addition to the role standardization questions played in making of unitary space, engineers such as Parsons undertook railway surveys in China and posited notions of standard time for machinery development in industrial ethnographies published in such venues as McClures. After tracing the course of these standardization projects, monetary and infrastructural, this paper will grapple with how their partial and unanticipated outcomes shaped dynamics of lock-in and dependency in the twentieth century.</p>","Standardizing Infrastructure In The Era Of The Open Door And Dollar Diplomacy"

Two months prior, police had forced their way into an NOI mosque, disrupting a religious service. Police claimed they were responding to an anonymous tip of a man with a gun. When members of the NOI attempted to block the police and their dogs from entering, the police arrested the two Muslims on the spot, while a grand jury would later indict seventeen more. This incident was an opening salvo in a larger campaign of state repression meant to drive the burgeoning Rochester chapter of the NOI out of existence. Local police and fire officials would continue to harass the men at their services, demanding entrance, while the courts would try these men no fewer than four times over the course of a year, adding unlawful assembly charges when it seemed they would not be able to convict on the assault and felonious riot charges. While the police state in Rochester claimed it was responding to a crime wave instigated by the Nation of Islam, the larger black community saw an attempt to curb the newly emboldened and unified black movement. Locally, that movement had instituted a Police Review Board (1962), made inroads with Malcolm X, and on the state level, lent support to NOI inmates who were suing New York State for constitutional protections for their religion in the prison system.</p>","State Repression Of The Nation Of Islam In Rochester, Ny, And Beyond"

These trends stand in contrast to the radical impetus of the gay liberation movement, but even these basic liberal advances have not been realized by teachers in the conservative institution of schools. Why not? What does this arc of queer educational history indicate about the profession of the American teacher? My analysis of the changing status of LGBTQ+ teachers begins in the 1950s and focuses on the elementary and secondary levels of schooling.

In Memphis, Tennessee, local circuit courts were flooded by suits against the local streetcar company. Months after challenging the constitutionality of racially segregated streetcars, black Memphians turned to the courts to demand equal treatment on segregated streetcars. They were overwhelmingly successful. In this paper, I will examine how African Americans so swiftly adopted, and adapted to, this new legal framework. First, I detail how information sharing within black communities in Memphis enabled litigants to adapt to this new legal framework and bring suit. Second, I consider what accounts for the high rates of success enjoyed by black litigants, asking how race shaped—and did not shape—the experiences of men and women in local county courts across the South. Recent scholarship on African Americans and the civil courts in the twentieth-century has focused, almost exclusively, on the appellate level. My work offers insight into how blacks understood and interacted with the courts in their daily lives. It also complicates our understanding of race and the law during racial segregation: while <i>Plessy v Ferguson</i> ushered in an era of racial segregation, it did not shutter all avenues for black legal action.</p>","Streetcars, Segregation And Civil Suits: Black Litigants In Memphis Civil Courts"

Brandon receives much less attention for his sharp, biting cartoons in the African American journal <i>Freedomways</i>, work he described in 1974 as a giant step away from being the butt of a joke and another giant step into the position of pointing an accusative finger.This paper will sketch out how Brandons work in <i>Freedomways </i>points that finger in ways that connect it to the New Left. While <i>Freedomways</i> published articles on the revolutionary potential of the youth movement, began using the terms liberation and black power, and presented the superni**er of blaxploitation films as a folk hero, Brandons cartoons illustrated (so to speak) a move away from obligatory politeness to a declarative rejection of systemic racism. He depicted characters called Superblack and Soul Brother, called out polite covering-up of racism, and efficiently used Afrocentric clothing and hairstyles to convey a move toward self-definition (and construct the meaning of his cartoons). This paper will combine historicizing of Brandons work with close textual readings of cartoons that <i>Freedomways </i>published. It will also offer provisional thoughts on the relative neglect accorded to black left cartooning and its impact on 1960s U.S. radicalism generally.</p>","Superblack: Brumsic Brandons Freedomways Cartooning"

The program was initially established by the U.S. Information Agency in 1985, at the request of a private company, the American Institute for Foreign Study, and later came under the supervision of the State Department. This paper will explore the history of the expanding au pair industry, and how the state cooperated with au pair agencies to create a system of inexpensive migrant labor to address Americas child care crisis. I will examine labor cases such as like Beltran v. InterExchange, and other ways that au pairs have resisted various forms of exploitation. I will also look at how au pairs and the au pair program interact with and affect other forms of child care labor, including domestic nannies and migrant domestic workers. I seek to place the au pair program in the context of a broader system of transnational migration to provide child care labor. While au pairs receive low wages, limited benefits and limited regulation, their position is often a relatively privileged one in the context of other domestic worker programs, such as the A3, B1, and G5 visas. I argue that over the past half century, the state has worked with private industry to find solutions to Americas need for affordable child care in various forms of migrant labor; the result has been a multitiered and racialized system of transnational migration that has become embedded within state bureaucracy and the law.</p>","Supplying Care: Public/Private Collaborations In The Creation Of The Au Pair Program"

It makes a comparison between immigration lawyers for the Chinese and pension lawyers for black Civil War veterans. In the general trend of an emerging administrative state, late nineteenth-century America witnessed an unprecedented expansion of federal departments overseeing immigration and welfare issues. A national movement excluding Chinese immigrants gave rise to organized state surveillance of immigration; meanwhile, the system of Civil War pension distribution also called for sophisticated examination of the eligibility of over 2 million Union veterans and their families, including over 180,000 African Americans. Immigration and pension bureaus were created to guard the racialized barriers against Chinese immigration and Civil War pension for African Americans. These barriers gave rise to lucrative niches in the marketplace for legal service. Driven by a mixture of personal, ideological, and financial reasons, a small but significant number of white lawyers chose to help these minorities and, for decades, served as a vital intermediary between federal bureaucracy and minority cultures. These lawyers work made them suspicious in the eyes of federal officials, especially when lawyers protested the officials arbitrary, prejudiced decisions. While many turn-of-the-century lawmakers championed racial hierarchy over racial justice, complaints about these lawyers flooded the reports, correspondence, and personal papers of federal employees. This paper argues that these complaints subjected lawyers to state surveillance. However, systematic surveillance also incorporated lawyers into the system and empowered the savvier ones to become integral players in several distinct ethnic worlds and promote meaningful dialogues between the state and minorities.</p>","Surveilling Unworthy Brokers: Federal Agencies, White Lawyers For The Minorities, And The Search For Racial Management, 1873–1924"

The report demonstrates that teachers feel uncomfortable teaching about slavery, textbooks inadequately address slavery, and students have a limited understanding of slavery. To supplement their report, the authors produced a guide for teachers to help them bring slavery into the classroom in a more intentional way that will enable students to gain a thorough and nuanced understanding of slavery. In my presentation, I will discuss how I integrated the SPLC report into my U.S. history survey. After spending two class sessions teaching students about slavery in the antebellum South, I assigned the report and asked students to reflect on their K–12 experiences learning about slavery. Then, using the textbook rubric provided by the SPLC, they evaluated our course textbook. Finally, exploring the resources provided in the supplementary material, students designed lesson plans for teaching slavery. Flipping the perspectives of students by having them look at slavery from a teachers perspective enhanced their understanding of slavery, enabled them to identify the problems with how slavery is taught, and provided opportunities to address those problems. By sharing my success with this approach, my presentation will provide an effective model for teaching slavery to undergraduates, and more generally demonstrate the benefits for students when the class is turned upside down and they are asked to investigate how a historical topic is taught.</p>","Teaching Students To Critically Evaluate How Slavery Is Taught"

When vaudeville actors first invented the grapevine game as a joke about the flaws of communication with the new telephone, they were speaking to a receptive audience less enthusiastic about mechanical invention than the phones cheerleaders. When Charlie Chaplin became part of the machine in <i>Modern Times</i>, his use of literal phrasing—he is, famously, physically inside the machine, processed by it—carried forward in cinematic form a template for technological critique about industrialization. Satire works when it pokes fun at something that has a general degree of understanding by its audience. Electricity, telephones, and factories had become part of popular culture when satirical responses called into question their presumed cultural value. The paper takes its cue from work by Ruth Schwartz Cowan, David Edgerton and the co-hort of technology studies scholars who examine the ways maintenance and use dominate the life of technologies rather than innovation and novelty. Satirical commentaries reveal assumptions about how users appreciate and understand technological novelty. They sharpen readers&quot; view of what the novel contribution seeks to do and how it confronts accepted cultural norms. Drawing from the satirical press of the late nineteenth-century and vaudeville archives of the early twentieth centuries, it traces a line of consistent critique about those who benefit and those who feel beleaguered by the incursion of new technological systems.</p>","Technological Resistance Is A Joke: How Satirists And Comics Cracked Back At Triumphalist Innovators In The Early 1900s"

Indeed, much of its wartime content advanced the argument that the real damage wrought by slavery was to republican ideals, not to the enslaved. This paper explores two strands of discourse that appeared in the <i>Atlantic</i>: one that clung to the idea of the war as purifying and; the other that, as Stephen Knadler observed, connected the development of societies to innate racial characters. By way of one example, James Russell Lowell, the abolitionist poet and the magazines first editor, gave voice to the first strand when he ruefully acknowledged that the wars dead was worth the sacrifice. It is not until our earthen vessels are broken, he explained that we find and truly possess the treasures that was laid up in them. Six months later, Nathaniel Hawthornes description of a party of contrabands, exemplified the second. So rudely were they attired, he remarked, so picturesquely natural in manners, and wearing such a crust of primeval simplicity … that they seemed a kind of creature by themselves, not altogether human, but perhaps quite as good. These two strands worked in tandem, offering us a way to see the role of print in the cultural and intellectual enterprise of reforging the white republic.</p>","The Atlantic Monthlys Civil-Izing Narrative, 1861–1865"

Activists from each group had often worked independently of one another throughout the 1960s—forming temporary alliances via the labor movement, through coordinated efforts to desegregate Dallas schools, and together in the War on Poverty. However, three highly controversial police-related shootings in the early 1970s pushed the Black Panther party, the Brown Berets, and the Bois dArc Patriots, a white working-class organization, to form a triumvirate alliance to address the pressing housing and gentrification crisis, to access quality jobs, and to end police brutality. This paper demonstrates the larger significance of cross-racial coalitions of the long civil rights movement by arguing that black, brown, and white activists forged an interconnected network that allowed activists outside of these organizations to communicate and collaborate. The triumvirate was not a limiting alliance. On the contrary, it allowed activists from each organization to bridge new relationships with other activists who were also working toward similar goals of police accountability.</p>","The Birth Of The Triumvirate Alliance: Black, Brown, And White Organizing Against Police Brutality In Dallas, Texas"

Like most other places where it existed, slavery had little if any respect for the black family in the Keystone State. Even after the passage of gradual abolition legislation in 1780, enslavers could still break up families and sell children or parents to faraway places—as long as they did so within the commonwealth. Gradual abolition, however, did create a paper trail that makes it possible to reconstruct certain family relations through the maternal line. This paper will explain and demonstrate this method. After 1788 in Pennsylvania, slaveholders were required to register the children of the women they enslaved women with the county clerk or forfeit the childs servitude. These records exist for several counties in the Pennsylvania interior, but to varying stages of completeness. In some counties, for instance, enslavers identified the mothers of the children they registered, while in others they did not. Some enslavers identified former owners, most did not. Only by constructing databases that treat these slave returns as one source among many can we begin to identify black familial relationships during the age of gradual abolition. Identifying these relationships is a crucial step in understanding how unfree black Pennsylvanians resisted and survived their continued servitude.</p>","The Black Family And The Archive During Slavery's Waning Days In The Pennsylvania Interior"

Escorted by members of the Salvation Army womens league, the men were afforded a behind-the-scenes tour of the zoo grounds. An employee documenting the event snapped photos of the blinded vets petting a python and stroking the trunk of an elephant. Similar scenes took place across the country, as zoos sought to give back to the nations war-wounded through public (and often well-publicized) displays of patriotic sympathy. Seventy-five years later, American zoos continue to highlight their service on behalf of disabled veterans. Drawing upon news reports, archival evidence, interviews, and visual culture, this talk explores zoos contributions to wartime and postwar civic culture. From World War I to the present day, zoos have routinely used wartime crises to highlight their patriotic bona fides, especially when it comes to helping disabled veterans. Indeed, the industry has long promoted zoos as important sites of therapy and healing—spaces where the blinded, the physically scarred, or even the shell-shocked might find temporary relief. Ultimately, this talk uses the zoo to examine how many twentieth-century American institutions developed a performative culture of thankfulness when it comes to disabled veterans, a series of public rituals, recitations, and displays that temporarily acknowledges veterans physical and mental ailments while downplaying the permanent nature of their injuries.</p>","The Blind Men And The Elephant: American Zoos, Disabled Veterans, And The Performative Culture Of Thankfulness"

One crucial way consulates served this function was through consular officials interactions with local, state, and federal officials in the United States to address the imprisonment of Mexican migrants and repatriation and deportation. This paper examines how Mexican nationals in Kansas, Nebraska, and Missouri contested their incarceration and facilitated their repatriation through correspondence with Mexican consulates in Kansas City and St. Louis. Consuls and other Mexican officials intervened on behalf of Mexican migrants disproportionately incarcerated during the 1910s and 1920s. At times, consuls succeeded in commuting sentences at the expense of repatriation. This process shifted during the economic turmoil of the Great Depression, when migrants increasingly asked consulates and the Mexican state for aid to repatriate, forcing Mexican officials to become more active in migration control in the United States. The Mexican Ministry of Foreign Relations operated as a crucial participant in migration control in the lower Midwest, permitting the movement of some Mexicans while denying others the right to return to Mexico. This paper offers new interpretations of the role of Mexican consulates in the United States by centering the voices of Mexican migrants to understand their power, or lack thereof, in contesting incarceration and migration control, while simultaneously challenging scholarly assumptions of U.S.-dominated immigration policy.</p>","The Carceral Corridor Of The Lower Midwest: Mexican Migrants, Mexican Consulates, And The Negotiation Of Incarceration And Migration Control During The Interwar Years"

The congress brought together delegates from reservations throughout the region and a number of Catholic officials, including the papal delegate to the United States. It was the largest gathering of its kind. Yet Indigenous peoples would continue attending not only Catholic convocations but also large Episcopal and Congregational meetings in the upper Missouri River valley through the mid twentieth century. As scholars have shown, Indigenous peoples used these meetings for their own purposes, melding Christian and Lakota religious practices and carrying on Indigenous traditions of gift giving. This paper situates the religious convocations from the early twentieth century within the longer history of Indigenous diplomacy and communication in the upper Missouri River valley. By traveling throughout the river valley to attend the convocations, delegates visited homelands, communicated with friends and relatives on neighboring reservations, and crossed reservation borders. While Catholic officials believed that these meetings would supplant Indigenous ceremonies, Indigenous peoples used them to maintain older Indigenous networks along the Missouri River.</p>","The Catholic Sioux Congress Of 1910 And Indigenous Mobility In The Northern Plains"

In this paper, I explore the presss position as an agent in the movement toward the Chickasaw Nations economic, political, and cultural sovereignty. To do so, I uncover the history that enabled the presss establishment, with particular attention to how the nations financial portfolio and gaming enterprises under the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) make such financing possible. Within the twelve year period spanning 1987 and 2009, for instance, the nations annual budget soared from $700,000 to $800,000,000, with more than $60,000,000 devoted to tribal culture, heritage, and history, including the press. In fiscal year 2017, the nation reported that gaming revenue alone totaled $1.44 billion. Thus, coming into fruition in this post-IGRA moment, the Chickasaw press emerged as the nation used business to advance a robust heritage infrastructure. In this way, the press demonstrates how the Chickasaw Nation deploys its sovereignty through economic development to become the author of its own cultural and historical discourse. The presss innovation in bringing together traditional knowledge with cutting-edge technologies thrusts the Chickasaw Nation to the forefront of what has become a strategy for political and cultural sovereignty employed by tribes nationally. In this paper, I draw on oral histories and engage the growing body of literature on indigenous economic development.

While her doctor was willing to perform it, the hospital refused to allow it, asserting that it violated the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Hospitals (ERDs). Taylor sued, and a district court sided with her, arguing that the receipt of federal funds made the hospital a state actor rather than a religious one. The bishops were furious. If they could not prohibit sterilizations in accordance with Catholic doctrine, they said, they would start shuttering Catholic hospitals.Several months later, in 1973, Congress passed the Church Amendment, the first federal health care conscience clause. It allowed doctors, nurses, and hospitals to refuse to perform abortions or sterilizations on the basis of religious or moral convictions without jeopardizing federal funding. As the foundation of subsequent federal and state conscience clauses, the Church Amendment operates as a powerful tool that enables healthcare providers and institutions to opt out of providing—and thereby restrict access to—politically contested medical interventions.Through the legislative history of the Church Amendment and the legal history of religious hospitals, this paper examines how, over the twentieth century, courts naturalized Catholic hospitals as non-religious spaces while Congress granted exemptions to them as religious spaces. It shows, therefore, how corporate conscience rights emerged much earlier than typically assumed, through non-profit religious hospitals. It highlights how carefully crafted historical narratives and masked corporate identities quietly enabled a major religious and political pivot with consequences unforeseen by almost everyone—except New York senator Jacob Javits. </p>","The Church Amendment Reconsidered: Lost Assumptions Of The First Federal Health Care Conscience Clause"

From the 1940s to the late 1960s a broad cadre of elite U.S. commentators argued that the male citizens putative willingness to exact and suffer military violence on behalf of his country was a key tenet of a vital democracy in the Cold War context. Experts legitimized the citizen-soldier model and praised the United States as a society in which (theoretically) individual freedom and national mobilization mixed in just the right proportions. In practice, privileged men were usually removed from the prospect of actual fighting. But Americans propagated their citizen-soldier ethos in part to celebrate a sophisticated attitude to military duty, superior to that of the Soviets, which they assumed to be oppressive and regimented. As the demands of the Vietnam War broadened the pool of men under threat of conscription, Americans across the political spectrum increasingly recognized the draft as a serious threat. President Richard M. Nixon initiated the all-volunteer force in 1973 partially to alleviate these concerns. That reform required ethical grounding, especially because it exacerbated class biases by absolving middle-class Americans from the prospect of military service. Relying on a range of state and nonstate archives this paper argues that influential commentators in policy making, reportage, and academic circles, worked to alleviate such ethical reservations by promising that decoupling military service from citizenship would usher in a freer, more peaceful, and more innocent society.</p>","The Citizen-Soldier Must Die: Inventing The Ethical Case For The All-Volunteer Force In The 1970s U.S."

Claiming to promote the interests of true Americans in rural, farming, and frontier communities, they constituted liberty as a function of whiteness and formulated whiteness as a privilege predicated on subjugation. In this worldview, the white laboring class—southern yeomanry and free labor, alike—served the conservative function in U.S. society, but only so long as they benefitted from the material co-existence and slave labor of an innately inferior black population. Slavery was conservative, the balance-wheel of American democracy.The decision of prolabor northern Democrats to throw their political fortunes in with the pro-slavery South generated a political party that positioned racial nationalism as the solution to class conflict. In their effort to reconcile the needs of southern slave-holders with the political desires of the white working class, the Democrats developed an alternative mode of conservatism designed to appear populist, even as it systematically attacked democratic institutions. The Democrats exploited the language of popular reform and individual autonomy, promising to rid the government of corruption, to reduce its size and reach, to remove government interference in commerce, and to restore to each white man the liberty to pursue his own unique destiny. This paper traces the aggressive and polarizing popular politics through which the Democrats promoted a popular conservatism, in which the commitment to whiteness became a measure of party loyalty.</p>","The Color Of Loyalty: Conservatism And Racial Nationalism In Antebellum Politics"

Work, Race, And Ability In The History Of U.S. Capitalism Around 1900</h5></p><p>This paper examines the intersections of race, time, and ableism in the making of wartime/interwar labor economies of the Detroit auto industry. Time—or more specifically clock-based temporalities—whether as units of measurements, discipline, commodities or lived experiences were and remain one of the defining characteristics of industrial modernity. How peoples and societies choose to mark time via the rhythms of nature or the rigidity of the clock varies across historical contexts. Time is relative, born of specific historical contingencies; a phenomenon that is both an agent and affect of social difference. Time-work management was constitutive of the new industrial Fordist order, which emerged in the interwar years. Indeed a working bodys in/ability to master time, to embody temporal discipline—on both physical and physiological levels—was a key metric of industrial fitness. This paper analyzes how the new temporal regimes engendered by assembly line mass production created new taxonomies and hierarchies of racial and bodily fitness. Though black workers had long been seen as defective by definition due to their ostensible physical and mental inferiority, this degeneration explicitly coalesced in their oft-cited inability to embody and or internalize the temporal discipline required to master the infamous speed up. Drawing on the vast archival sources of the industrial management literature of the Ford Motor Company, African American social agencies, and the rising tide of Eugenic thought, this paper employs a temporal lens to trace the contours of racial and bodily inequality in early Fordist labor economies.</p>","The Color Of Working Hours: Historicizing Race, Time, And Ableism In Interwar Fordist Labor Economies"

That argument could also be made when examining plans for the expansion of Clevelands municipal airport. Even though the city had already experienced significant population loss, beginning in the 1970s local officials supported plans to clear sizable portions of a stable, white, working-class neighborhood, West Park, to support proposed airport expansion projects. That part of the neighborhood had already experienced population losses due to the construction of Interstate 480. While some welcomed the buyouts, others fought to save their homes. Many residents had a strong sense of place reinforced by family ties and strong institutions. Residents even held reunions to commemorate the loss of their neighborhood and fought (successfully) to save a Catholic church threatened by a decline in the number of parishioners. Although airport projects also resulted in the clearance of white, middle-class and suburban neighborhoods (mostly of post–World War II construction), these were not the only communities that bore the cost of the expansion of postwar air travel. African American and working-class neighborhoods also disappeared to make way for new runways and provide the ultimate solution for airport noise issues, clearance of those who would lodge the complaints.</p>","The Cost Of Air Travel: Cleveland Hopkins Airport And The West Park Neighborhood"

The implication  is that Zouaves were the casualty of a wartime national maturation or the battlefield vulnerability of their flamboyant uniforms. To the contrary, Zouave prestige emerged intact from the Civil War. Veterans clung to their Zouave identity, and new Zouave militia units formed, including black companies in the postemancipation South. Zouaves continued to flourish in circuses and vaudeville. Zouaves also remained a famous part of the French army, though temporarily diminished after the Franco-Prussian War and fall of Napoleon III. The gradual exclusion of Zouaves from American military culture was a postwar collaboration of the U.S. Army and its allies in the militia reform movement. The army co-opted Zouave tactics, but interstate drill competitions placed Zouave units in a separate category from infantry. The gender and ethnic fluidity of troupes such as Captain Keller&quot;s American Zouave Girls and the Peking Zouaves differed radically from the ideals of manhood and Anglo-Saxon destiny promoted by martial champions of the strenuous life. The notion that soldiers were performers conflicted with an idealization of military service as the epitome of authenticity. The fate of the Zouaves set the pattern for the turn-of-the-century army monopolization of what had been during the Civil War a decentralized and diverse military culture.   </p>","The Decline Of American Zouaves"

It gave the president the authority to designate National Monuments, and it criminalized through fines and imprisonment destruction and looting of cultural resources. Previous scholarship has highlighted the successes of the American Antiquities Act in allowing for the first protections of archeological sites in the Southwest. However, what were the human implications of these protections? American Indians resided in and around these cultural resources. The establishment of these sites as National Monuments involved the buying of allotments, negotiation long-standing treaties, and determining if rights to minerals and grazing in these areas still held after they became public land. This paper will examine the establishment of Southwestern National Monument through the lens of the Dine. This paper will discuss how the American Antiquities Act informed Department of Interior, National Park Service, and Office of Indian Affairs officials in understanding the process of making cultural resources into public lands. The three case studies within Southwestern National Monument I will use are Canyon De Chelly, Manuelito Archeological Complex, and Chaco Canyon. I will argue that in these three cases the Dine played a major role determining policy outcomes. The Dine developed their own interpretation not only of the American Antiquities Act but also of the preservation of cultural resources in the early twentieth century.</p>","The Dines Application Of The American Antiquities Act Of  Southwestern National Monuments"

Her experiences, often painful but largely joyous, speak to the impact of childhood trauma and social interaction among African-descent people, especially those living in the United States, as well as others of different racial/ethnic groups, socioeconomic classes, religions, sexual orientations, and points of view. Although this scholar has achieved the pinnacle of success, she routinely feels isolated among her family, friends, students, church family, and peers. Students, for example, generally ridicule her for her eyesight difficulties, oratory errors, physical appearance, lecture style, and kind nature toward others. Colleagues sometimes dismiss her as unintelligent and crazy. Family members often mistake her kindness for weakness and consider her eccentric views of life as abnormal. She even ruffles the feathers of supportive friends, colleagues, who see her vested interest in interracial reconciliation and intraracial uplift as foolhardy, contradictory, and naive. Although a member of the Christian faith, the historian believes strongly in the idea of a single God who speaks to others in many ways and through numerous religious perspectives. What concerns the historian most of all is her inability to separate her historical subject from the world she resides in daily. She feels strongly about what W. E. B. Du Bois described a century ago in The Souls of Black Folk as the double-consciousness of blackness. According to Du Bois, African-descent Americans lived as blacks and celebrated their identity while, ironically, despising themselves and each other for their darker hues, hair textures, vernacular, cultures, past histories, and ancestral homeland. Much of these contradictory views stemmed from their ongoing interactions with the larger society that, with few exceptions, socially, culturally, and financially marginalized them and had done so in numerous ways for centuries. This confusing state of being—loving ones self while hating ones self based on the ways others treat and define African-descent people—remains at the core of the authors life quagmires. Do these life-style actions point to an individuals eccentric character or to institutionalized lines of demarcation based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, and class? Can these ongoing internal battles be corrected? Can African-descent people transform their stagnant communal state of being? Should successful blacks remain committed to solving these problems? Do all blacks suffer from these issues? The author hopes this first step will stimulate dialogue and encourage other self-reflections, perhaps to begin ongoing conversations about race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and class among black people within the academy, and as a teaching tool for others, especially the next generation of future scholars and human beings.</p>","The Double Consciousness Of A Beautiful Soul In Higher Education"

Safety pamphlets described the art of walking to free the roadway for cars, street vending was restricted, and traffic lights were timed for automobile circulation. As traffic statistics highlighted the growing number of fatal accidents involving children and the elderly, concerns rose with projections of a rapidly expanding elderly population. In 1990 the World Health Organization called for age-friendly cities to accommodate aging populations, while densely populated New York City developed the Safe Streets for Seniors initiative, lengthening crossing times and widening sidewalks at the expense of automobile traffic. How did elderly pedestrians, construed as dangerous and disruptive, become politically powerful in urban planning? How did conflicts between the modern city and aging bodies emerge? How did public health institutions and aging Americans secure change? This paper explores changes to urban streets in New York City between 1920 and the present. It examines the rising visibility of elderly inhabitants, the relationships between the disabilities common in aging and disability activism, public health discussions of the needs of the elderly, and the resulting reconfigurations of the built environment. Drawing on historical maps and photographs, Department of Transportation records, public health records, and mainstream media, this paper offers insight into the rise of age-friendly cities and how they responded to, and at times ignored, aging Americans.</p>","The Elderly Navigating New York City: Old Age, Public Health, And The Politics Of The Urban Street, 1920–Present"

The passage of this amendment revealed a concerted effort to weaken workers collective notions of civic mindedness and culture and replace them with individualistic ideals of self-preservation. Watson wanted the right to treat workers as commodities. This effectively sidestepped labor laws tendency to consider, according to a 1940 memo of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), that a workers service cannot be separate from himself as a personality. This state effort to upend New Deal labor gains has yet to be fully told. The phrase freedom of work, taken from 1941 NAM memo, articulated an open shop philosophy and a form of astroturf populism: it took advantage of dissent among organized labor, an emerging patriotic moment, and a flourishing of New Deal freedom rhetoric to spin a Trumpian-like effort to argue managerial prerogative via the Trojan horse of right to work. Watsons intervention in the spring of 1941 insisted that the state protect an employers right to employ by claiming that the right to work is a property right to further divide union solidarity. This paper reveals how the NAM and Watson resisted the notion of worker security and democracy by piggybacking the idea of the right to work to Franklin D.

This paper focuses on the writings of composer Aaron Copland and on his engagement in the politics of music. The political context for their work prompted composers such as Copland to reflect on their work. No generation of composers wrote as diligently as did this group during the 1920s and 1930s. Copland was a key proponent of developing a particular American music. But while he sought to establish a peculiar American music, his music contradicted such claims by endorsing ideals of universal modernism. In doing so, Copland expanded on his generations exposure to European music (and on his own experience in Paris), which had left him committed to the European idea of modern music. Such contradictions inherent in Coplands writings, his music, and in his political engagement were tokens of his time. By comparing Copland to Austrian composer Ernst Krenek, this paper will show how Copland shared with exiled European composers in the United States the intellectual challenge to negotiate nationalism and universalism, and to create a national tradition from the universal language of music.</p>","The Ironies Of Cultural Nationalism In A Transnational Age.

Abolition And Radical Isms Of The Nineteenth Century</h5></p><p>In recent decades, scholars have revisited the activism of abolitionists following the American Civil War, demonstrating how the same principles of government by consent and the equality of man that drove abolition was later translated into anti-imperialism, womens suffrage, labor activism, and other reform efforts in the late nineteenth century. This paper examines the role of former Boston abolitionists in another emancipatory cause—that of the Russian people—in the 1880s-1890s. In 1881 a member of the Russian terrorist organization, the Peoples Will, arrived in the United States months after the group successfully assassinated Tsar Alexander II. In his appeal to the American people, he declared that Russian revolutionaries were the abolitionists of Russia. That same year, Wendell Phillips, in an oration to Harvard University, celebrated the terrorists as the George Washingtons and John Browns of St. Petersburg. Ten years later, the Russian revolutionary Sergei Stepniak-Kravchinskii visited Boston, to enlist former abolitionists in the revolutionary cause; the organization that came out of this effort, the Friends of Russian Freedom, counted three members of John Browns Secret Six. This paper compares the terrorism of the Russian regicides with that of John Brown, and argues that Boston abolitionists understood the cause of the Russian people as one and the same with that of the oppressed slave. In an era overshadowed by the assassination of President James A. Garfield and the Haymarket bombing, abolitionists provided essential support for Russian terrorists that helped distinguish them from other radical isms of the era.</p>","The John Browns Of St. Petersburg: Former Abolitionists And Russian Terrorism In The Late 19th Century"

This paper examines this era through the case of Walter Jenkins, a longtime staff assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who resigned in 1964 after journalists reported that he had arrested twice while cruising in a YMCA mens room. Jenkins was the highest ranking official to resign during the Lavender Scare as a result of his perceived homosexuality. The Jenkins case complicates accounts of the Lavender Scare that focus on antigay policy makers and progay activists, who clashed in public, and gay public servants, who suffered in private. The suffering of Jenkins, by contrast, was widely publicized and discussed. Moreover, coverage of the official inquiry undermined the logic of the security-risk concept: the FBI concluded that a man had, in fact, for eleven months, simultaneously kept the official secrets of the commander-in-chief and the personal secret of his own homosexual behavior. As the fate of Jenkins seemed worse than that of other officials who abused their office for private gain, Americans questioned whether gay public servants deserve such severe punishment.I will argue that the Jenkins scandal helps explain how the homophile movement was able, despite its extreme political powerlessness, to secure victory in 1975, when the Civil Service Commission relaxed the ban on gay civilian employees. The Jenkins case shows that publicity and the sympathy it generated helped augment the impact of activism in challenging the image of homosexuals as security risks unfit to serve. </p>","The Last Security Risk?

Their plan came to fruition in the construction of the Abyssinian Meeting House, which became the epicenter of Maine abolitionism and African American politics. The meetinghouse campaign represents one of the most visible moments of activism for these black Mainers, but their activities and influence extended into almost every aspect of nineteenth-century American history and politics. This paper explores the political endeavors of one of the progenitors of the meetinghouse plan, Reuben Ruby, in the decades that followed its construction. Over the course of his adult life, Reuben Ruby held local political appointments, campaigned on behalf of national parties, and shaped political debates surrounding slavery and abolition in his home state. Maine was one of the few states that allowed black men to vote: universal male suffrage was embedded in the states founding constitution of 1820. Therefore, from Maines beginnings, African Americans were a significant, yet often-overlooked, political constituency. But Rubys activism extended beyond electoral politics when he and his wife served tea to groups of abolitionists in their parlor, aided fugitive slaves, baptized their children, and faced daily indignities of racist discrimination. Beyond Maines borders, Ruby agitated for suffrage rights in other states and contributed to national movements opposing slavery and racism. Ruby is an example of how, on both a local and national level, African Americans fought to end slavery and expand democracy.</p>","The Life And Times Of Reuben Ruby, From Community Leader To National Activist"

Material cultures were generally local or national in extent, which limited the degree to which goods traveled around the world. By contrast, todays world is one in which supply chains girdle the earth, iPhones are in use in every country, and objects cross borders easily. This paper examines the achievement of a global, rather than local or national, material culture. Doing so required not only cross-border standardization (the global screw thread is a fine example) but also a number of other transformations. Objects, particularly complex electronic ones, needed to be world-proofed so they could withstand transit and different climates. Cultures had to be adapted to receive and attach significance to foreign objects. World War II, in which one country (the United States) took on the task of supplying goods to every war theater, was the pivotal moment in creating a global material culture. It not only laid the foundations for todays globalization but it also made the United States the central stall of the newly built global marketplace.</p>","The Limits Of My Standards Are The Limits Of My World: World War II And The Birth Of A Global Material Culture"

This narrative holds especially true in LGBT history: in particular, the 1973 DSM (<i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>) revision campaign has long been hailed as a watershed victory, wherein activists cast off their pathologization as disordered and affirmed homosexuality as a minority subject position. Although reformers sought to legitimize homosexuality by disaggregating it from madness, many radicals embraced the affinities of madness and sexual deviance as forces that could erode normative social and psychic organization. This talk draws from the print culture of progressive gay and insane liberation movements, emphasizing their many cross-pollinations. For queer and mad radicals alike, what made madness and deviant desire valuable were their anti-identitarian, deterritorializing properties: their ability to dissolve the integrity of the self and to make the subject vulnerable to the transformative forces of the world of objects. In this milieu, lunacy became an exalted political state—it denoted a condition of insanity associated not just with sexual excess but also with agential capacities secured through the selfs subordination to influence: the powers of the moon. Beyond illuminating new genealogies of queer and disability coalition, this paper argues that the 1970s mad-queer milieu also challenges the primacy of subject-based frames for understanding postwar radicalism. I look especially to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattaris <i>Capitalism and Schizophrenia </i>as counterpoint to another major text of this time, one more frequently used as a road map by LGBT historians today: Michel Foucaults The Will to Knowledge.</p>","The Lunar Effect: Self-Loss And Cosmic Consciousness In The Mad-Queer 1970s"

The stories of Texas Chicanas running for public office, their work in the Womens Political Caucus, and their engagement in civic organizations grabbed local, state, and national attention. Although some Chicanas lost campaigns and other won elections, the awareness that these women created, and the public conversations about Chicanas in politics mattered and had lasting ramifications.

In the wake of the 1968 sanitation workers strike and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the MPD feared that young African Americans inspired by black power ideology and rhetoric and white students radicalized by the Vietnam War would stoke discontent, create chaos, and encourage violence in Memphis. The paper draws on author interviews with participants in Memphis movement organizations, archival records, and, most notably, the case file from a four-decade-old lawsuit that accused the MPD of collecting political intelligence in violation of citizens constitutional rights. Given that Red Squad records are difficult to locate, this case file, which includes raw surveillance records that I will display during the presentation, provides a unique evidentiary basis. Red Squads such as Memphiss worked with their more well-known counterparts in the Federal Bureau of Intelligence, military intelligence, and state investigative agencies to create a web of surveillance in which no target was too small, no threat too insignificant to merit attention. Driven by fear, the police saw threats everywhere and deployed the power of the state against those it perceived as enemies.</p>","The Memphis Red Squad And The Assault On The Movement, 1968–1976"

This work, curated primarily by students, initially illuminated recent acts of police brutality against black men in America. Over the next two years, subsequent students of the course chose to expand the project by adding the stories of other communities of color, including women. The exhibition has continued and continues to grow each year. The purposes of this project are to say the names of and remember the lives lost at the hands of those sworn to protect the public. Further, this exhibition captures the realities, grief, and struggles of the surviving loved ones. The goal of this showcase is not to slander authorities or promote being antipolice.

First, we will introduce new archival research on three presidents responses to HIV/AIDS in the critical first twenty years of the epidemic. For the Ronald Reagan administration, we will extend the pioneering archival research of Jennifer Brier. Archival records for the George H. W. Bush administration have received little historical attention. We are among the first historians to use records related to HIV at the Bill Clinton presidential library. We will use records newly opened in response to our Freedom of Information Act requests. We will use these archival sources for our second purpose—an interpretation of presidential inaction during the first twenty years of the HIV/AIDS crisis. The Reagan administrations indifference—even hostility—is well known, but Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and Admiral James Watkins bucked the presidents advisers from the religious Right. The Bush administration reluctantly supported the Ryan White Care Act, the landmark federal support HIV program. Although Clinton promised new focus on HIV, he sidestepped the gnarly political issues. He blocked federal funding for needl-exchange programs, even though they were demonstrated to save lives. The Congressional Black Caucus pushed Clinton toward action on HIV in Africa. The United States enacted the very best and the very worst HIV policies, observed public health scholar Ronald Bayer. New research on presidential decision making provides depth to understanding how stigma and a rhetoric of the deserving and undeserving inhibited presidential leadership in the greatest public health crisis of the post–World War II era.</p>","The Plague And The Presidents: Aids Avoidance By Reagan, Bush, And Clinton"

I use those records to call attention to the ubiquity of unauthorized European immigration to the United States in the twentieth century and to perform a qualitative analysis of data that cannot be found in annual statistics on unauthorized immigration gathered from government agencies. I use IWL immigration case files to explore a variety of subjects. As noted by historians, the ability to adjust ones status from illegal to legal immigrant was a white privilege throughout much of the twentieth century. This work builds from that argument by testing the case of Italian migrants and exploring the mechanisms through which the state facilitated the normalization of certain migrants and not others. My research also builds off of existing scholarship to look at disparities found in the opportunities (or lack thereof) for male versus female migrants. IWL case files also provide windows into the mechanisms of community policing and also the transnational commercial networks that migrants used to gain entry into the United States. This paper will examine how the state, ethnic communities, and migrants own legal, economic, social, and cultural networks determined who crossed the threshold from an illegal to legal body in the United States at midcentury.</p>","The Privileges Of Illegality: Unauthorized Italian Immigration To The United States And Adjustment Of Status In The Twentieth Century"

During the Missouri Crisis of 1819–1821, southerners contended that black people could never be citizens of the American Republic. Why was black citizenship so threatening? I will argue that early national slaveholders promoted a racialized polity to protect slavery and suppress black politics. In the aftermath of Gabriels Rebellion, Virginia ordered that enslaved people emancipated after 1806 had to leave the state within a year. Upper South and lower North states subsequently adopted laws banning or hindering free black in-migration, likely inspiring Missouris proposed ban on free black migrants, which forced the citizenship question into Congress in 1820. While southern masters could use state-level powers to police black people, the Missouri debates revealed the difficulties slaveholders faced at the national level. Multiple northern legislators defended black citizenship in 1820 and 1821, documenting a long history of black political participation in the United States. Black claims to citizenship posed a practical challenge to slavery and an ideological challenge to the white supremacist polity slaveholders hoped to build. To defend free communities of color, northern blacks advanced a broad vision of American citizenship, by turns cosmopolitan and nationalist, that insisted on equality before the law. Looking at the Missouri Crisis and subsequent conflicts in the 1820s, this paper will explain how black citizenship politics threatened slaveholder power, setting the stage for the citizenship revolution of the Civil War era.</p>","The Problem Of Black Citizenship"

The proximity of Washington Navy Yard and the Marine Barracks near many gay and lesbian bars meant that Capitol Hill became the epicenter of tension between homosexual communities and military personnel in the 1970s and 1980s, with violence often erupting at nightlife establishments. Such tensions exposed divisions within D.C.&quot;s gay liberation movement. Attacks at lesbian bars received scant media and police attention, while marine attacks at gay clubs led to citywide condemnation. The paper also explores the causes and ramifications of this nightlife turf war on broader gay politics in Washington, D.C.

Eisenhowers massive interstate highway system and the legendary takedown of Robert Moses by Jane Jacobs. However, debates over roads began long before the mid-twentieth century. Most importantly, the debates began in rural America. In the 1880s the League of American Wheelmen lobbied for federal involvement in rural road improvement. By 1893, Congress answered the call of ardent bicyclists and authorized a federal Office of Road Inquiry (ORI) under the U.S. Department of Agriculture. With no authority, a mere $10,000 budget, and two employees, the ORI was only authorized to collect road data. By the early 1900s, the small federal office supervised the construction of demonstration roads in small towns across the country, encouraged the establishment of local highway commissions, and drafted legislation for federal aid for road building. The Federal Aid Road Act (1916) and the Federal Aid Highway Act (1921), launched an era of scientific road building that would lay the foundation for our national highway infrastructure. This paper explores the inequalities among local, state, and federal authority in rural road improvement. The politicization of where and when roads would be financed—and who would build them—launched some communities into modernity and left others stuck in the mud. The growing power of the federal governments road office, and the shift in their expertise from dispersed to centralized reveals illuminating fissures within the Americas federal/state compromise.</p>","The Road To Nowhere: The Politicization Of Rural Road Improvement, 1890–1920"

Indeed, truckers have come to symbolize a broader anxiety about the future of work and are a case study of the challenges of mitigating the negative effects of job loss, disruption, and alienation that may follow automation. This current wave of automation and concomitant anxiety is not the first in trucking. This paper looks back to the 1950s and 1960s, the first time the robots came, and how truckers, most led by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, responded to labor-saving technology. This historical perspective provides critical lessons to inform todays debates about automation. Contrary to common assumptions in todays debates, truckers did not take a luddite approach to new technology, fighting to retard technological development to save their jobs. Workers frequently supported labor-saving technologies, but they did so because they believed that they could influence the policies that would ensure they shared in the benefits of those technologies and that government could effectively address negative impacts. Today, in an age of growing inequality and precariousness, and in the absence of a robust voice for labor, it should not surprise us that automation in trucking is playing out much differently. The paper concludes by suggesting policy prescriptions that follow from this historical case.</p>","The Robots Are Coming! Again!"

Davenport from viewing it as a new problem in the early decades of the twentieth century. Davenports published writings on race-crossing, as it was termed, reveal a preoccupation with mulattoes, a group he referred to as a nuisance, badly put together, and ineffective. Race crossing soon became a topic worthy of sustained study, and mixed race persons targets of eugenic scrutiny. As Davenport outlined the dangers mulattoes posed to society, he turned not only to Mendelian genetics, but also to antebellum medical discourses about mixed race peoples bodies. As this paper demonstrates, Davenports race-crossing studies: <i>Heredity of Skin Color in Negro White Crosses</i> (1913) and <i>Race Crossing in Jamaica</i>, (1929), closely adhered to antebellum-era scientific investigations into race that took for granted the idea that black peoples bodies were distinctive and inferior; however, his books differed because they relied on genetics and new statistical methods to reach those conclusions. These studies did more than measure and quantify mixed race skin—they rehabilitated, refined, and in some cases sanctioned, long-held beliefs from the era of slavery about the physical and mental limitations of mixed race people. And while elements of Davenports studies did debunk myths about the mulatto body—including claims of innate infertility—the studies also stoked fears about the ability of the offspring of black and white parents to infiltrate the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>","The Shadow Of Slavery: Measuring Miscegenation In The Early Twentieth Century"

It examines the public image that Jacqueline Cochran (Director of Women Pilots, U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II) sought to portray in the media not only of herself but also of the WASP program participants, in contrast with media reporting on the WASP program and the private lived experiences of individual WASPs. The WASPs volunteered to serve in the Army Air Forces for the duration of the national emergency plus six months, with a promise of militarization during their wartime service. However, as government contract employees they were forced to pay for transportation to attend training, uniforms, meals, and lodging, and when 38 women were killed during their military service, their sister WASPs had to take up a collection to transport them home, and their families paid for their burials. Moreover, inaccurate media reporting, portrayals in Hollywood films, and a strategic campaign by male Civil Aviation Administration contract pilots resulted in Congresss failure to pass WASP militarization legislation and early termination of the program on December 20, 1944. After the war, the WASPs service was largely forgotten, and they were denied veterans status, financial compensation, and GI Bill benefits. The arguments presented in this paper are supported by interviews with five WASP veterans. By examining these womens wartime military service, as pilots in a field heretofore deemed masculine or mens work, this paper provides insights into the rewards and punishments associated with gender nonconformity and female masculinity in the labor force during and after the war. This work adds to the literature by providing new understandings of WASP veterans lived experiences within the cultural and gendered norms of the pre– and post–World War II era.</p>","The Women Airforce Service Pilots Of World War II: Public Images And Private Realities And The Burdens Of Lasting Progress"

In the preceding months, Hadden, a veteran gay activist, had grown increasingly concerned about reports of the emerging AIDS epidemic. Halfway into his contract, he brought the epidemic to Robertis attention, who immediately hired him as a legislative assistant specialising in AIDS. Hadden was one of a number of California gay activists who transitioned into policy-making roles during the early years of the epidemic. Their stories complicate existing accounts of the AIDS crisis, which often privilege the response of the Reagan Administration and the direct action advocacy of ACT UP. While the federal government ignored the crisis, California legislators responded by passing a flurry of AIDS-related bills, which were often written by gay legislative assistants.   This paper will examine how the careers of these gay policy-makers complicates existing literature on both the AIDS epidemic and the broader relationship between sexuality and the state. By the end of the 1980s, Hadden and his colleagues exerted a strong influence over Californias response to AIDS, marking the fragmentation of the straight state along regional lines.</p>","The Straight State Reconsidered: Gay Policy-Makers And The California Aids Epidemic"

Challenging The Nostalgia Trap In Politics, Popular Culture, And Historiography</h5></p><p>Scholars in our post–New Left historiographical period claim that the twentieth centurys first two decades should best be defined as a Progressive Era. In this period, many reformers sought to address the excesses of the previous era, the Gilded Age, by promoting numerous community and workplace-based reforms. Rejecting the old corporate liberal interpretations, such historians have maintained that we must take seriously reforms passed from above, including efforts by president Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelts Square Deal, the name he coined and popularized after establishing a committee to help settle the 1902 anthracite coal strike in Pennsylvania, marked a turning point, since, most scholars insist, he approached the so-called labor question as an honest broker. This paper challenges this perspective by pointing out that Roosevelts labor policies helped inspire the antiunion open-shop movement, an employer-led campaign that consisted of individuals from both in and outside of industrial relations settings. Members of the Citizens Industrial Association of America (an assortment of union opponents, including vigilantes from the nineteenth century), were thrilled by the Square Deal because it explicitly promoted the open-shop principle, a managerial system that was supposedly welcoming to both union and nonunion members. They named their monthly magazine the Square Deal and often cited Roosevelt during their antiunion onslaughts. Roosevelts admirers did not see the president as antilabor; instead, they believed he was fair-minded and committed to protecting both unions and the so-called free workers (scabs). The ruling-class remained emboldened and powerful while the union movement suffered.</p>","Theodore Roosevelt, The Rise Of The Open-Shop Movement, And The Myth Of The Square Deal"

I contend that Third World internationalism included all nonwhite persons who shared a common struggle, a common vision, and a common enemy: the conjuncture of North Atlantic (especially U.S.) imperialism, capitalist exploitation, and racism. As a theoretical position and discursive formation, Third World internationalism centered on anti-imperialism, anticolonialism, antiracism, and a challenge to capitalist exploitation. As well, it was a cultural and political enunciation of solidarity in opposition to so-called Western universalism, historicism, civilization, and developmentalism. I offer a discussion of Third World internationalism as a multifaceted historical formation at the conjuncture of post–World War II demands for economic redistribution, Cold War competition between capitalism and socialism, and the ascendance of the U.S. military and economic hegemony; as an insurgency of racialized, colonized, and oppressed peoples against white supremacist specifications of geopolitics; and as a structure of feeling constituted by struggles for decolonization, political independence, and economic self-determination. I pay particular attention the ways that anti-imperialism, decolonization, and black power insurgencies in the United States foregrounded the political economy of racism and oppression not least because structural lack was not ameliorated for the overwhelming majority of people—the revolutionary masses, the superexploited proletariat, militants engaged in urban rebellion and guerilla warfare—by the nominal gains of civil rights and independence movements. Third Worldist critiques of militarism, nuclear proliferation, Cold War geopolitics, and the denial of sovereignty, I argue, inhered in a broader anticapitalist and antiracist framework.</p>","Third World Internationalism As Critique Of Racial Capitalism During The Cold War"

The women who participated in the modern womens movement often carried into it their own assumptions about race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexuality, and religion, and they often failed to interrogate how their own social identities affected their views of womens liberation.Black womens political organizing during this wave reflects their own unique concerns about womens issues as well as how they could be addressed in the most meaningful and effective ways. Some organizations that black women started during the mid- to late-1970s reflect their attempt to engage in critical analysis of their problems, as well as proposing solutions to them. Among the most well known of these are the National Black Feminist Organization, the Third World Womens Alliance, and the Combahee River Collective.My paper will show how these organizations were a part of a trend in black American activism beginning in the 1960s in which women expanded the liberation agenda beyond race and gender issues to include those based on class, sexuality, religion, and ethnicity. Additionally, some of these organizations, particularly the Combahee River Collective, operated as a cutting-edge social change organization that served as an example to activists in other womens rights organizations of how they could engage in intersectional analysis of their problems, and work in coalition with activists who did not necessarily share the same identities, or have the same problems. Furthermore, I will connect the legacy of the Combahee River Collective to todays Movement for Black Lives.</p>","This Is How We Do It"

This paper explores the development of the Mexican American agenda of the&nbsp;U.S. Commission on Civil Rights&nbsp; (USCRC) during the early 1960s, a period of rapidly shifting societal change. Established permanently in the 1957 Civil Rights Act, the commission was charged, among other responsibilities, with holding hearings and conferences, receiving complaints from citizens and producing reports for the use of Congress and the president in the creation of federal policies.  Lack of knowledge of southwestern and Mexican American culture and history among USCRC northeastern-educated Anglo staff directors and Washington DC office employees, contributed to the initial perpetuation of stereotypes, flawed histories, and inadequate research agendas. USCRC staff at first responded reluctantly not only to top down demands from the White House, but also to charges of neglect and discrimination from Chicano advocacy group leaders.  The hiring of Mexican-descent staff members led to more robust and useful proposals.  Utilizing recently released unpublished correspondence and other materials at the National Archives, this paper  identifies how federal stakeholders initially identified and framed Mexican Americans, received push back and protest from advocacy groups, and altered its agenda with the incorporation of Mexican American perspectives and staff.</p>","Top-Down Chicano/A History?: The U.S. Commission On Civil Rights, Mexican American Advocacy Groups, And Education In The 1960s"

This paper traces the origins of liberal immigration reform back to the late 1920s to the 1930s, the onset of the era of restrictive immigration, when liberals began to advocate for administrative and legislative reform. They sought to reconcile the new principle of numerical immigration restriction and a more equitable criteria and practice of membership in the American polity. This paper will mainly discuss one of the oldest of liberal immigration reform coalitions, the Joint Conference on Immigration Policy, formed in 1930, and reorganized into the American Immigration Conference in 1953. Originally founded by around a dozen New York–based organizations, by the mid-1930s the loose coalition had some twenty members, including major faith-based organizations such as the American Jewish Committee, Federal Council of Churches, National Catholic Welfare Council, and the Young Womens Christian Association, and more secular organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Immigrants Protective League. They were yet to launch a full-frontal attack against the national origins quotas system and worked discreetly with government agencies rather than appearing in public with a unified voice, thus escaping the attention of many historians. This paper argues that early efforts to promote cross-faith and cross-ethnic cooperation to counter eugenicist restrictionism laid both the ideological and organizational foundations of post–World War II immigration reform.</p>","Towards A More Equal Immigration Policy: Prewar Origins Of Post–World War II Liberal Coalition And Immigration Reform"

The bureau asserts that BIE groups are motivated by perceptions of police brutality against African Americans and have spurred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement. This new iteration of the FBIs targeting of black Americans has its roots in the bureaus origins. Their attacks on black leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X are well known. Less studied, however, are the many black women who endured similar practices and costs. This paper explores how the FBI perfected many contemporary programs on a range of progressive and radical black women activists from the 1950s to the 1970s. It argues that black women organizers were susceptible to the patriarchal impulses of both the government and the public—a position that caused many to overlook the impact of bureau tactics on them, on the one hand, and caused agents to develop gender-specific schemes that targeted them, on the other. The paper identifies gender-specific tactics the FBI used to attack black women radicals and how these women combated surveillance. Reinserting black women into histories of surveillance and imprisonment challenges long-held ideas about the male-dominated focus of CONTELPRO. A focus on black womens survival in the face of such tactics also offers valuable insight into how we might think about the bureaus contemporary efforts to track and undermine black communities.</p>","Tracking Minds, Tracking Lives: The Fbis Past And Present Surveillance Of Black Women Activists"

Drawing on coroners records, newspaper accounts, and court records, this paper will examine how inequalities affected coroners inquests and verdicts as well as prosecutions, convictions, and sentences.

The press celebrated these convictions, often using racist language and stereotypes.  Domestic violence cases also reveal gender inequalities, as some women (particularly those with questionable reputations) were blamed for their own murders, at least by the St. Louis press.</p>","Unjust And Unequal: Death Investigations Into Homicides In St. Louis, Missouri, 1875 To 1885"

But as in other Mexican communities, Mexican nationals, both in the U.S. and Mexico, turned to the Mexican consulate in times of need. In Mexico they wrote to the consulate asking about their relatives in New York, while Mexicans in New York sought the consulates help when they faced hardships. Furthermore, the Mexican consulate played a role in conveying a positive image of Mexico within the United States, whether through the celebration of Mexican holidays or the downplaying of tumultuous events, such as the Cristero War (1926–1929) in Mexico. Despite this, the consulate aligned itself with the educated and professional Mexicans in the city who distinguished themselves from the popular masses—i.e., unskilled workers. They did so, for example, by having their own separate celebrations for Mexican Independence Day. While the consulate may have overlooked political and religious ties within the community, class served as a marker of inequality within the Mexican colonia. Class inequalities were most evident during the repatriation of Mexicans in the 1930s, when the consulate looked to steam and cargo ships as a way to transport Mexicans home. This paper focuses on New York as an unlikely destination for Mexican migrants, the Mexican colonia that formed, and the role the consulate played in the colonia.</p>","Unlikely Migrants: Mexicans In New York City, 1924–1932"

Many whose lives and homes were destroyed lived in a predominately Native American neighborhood known as Osh Kosh Camp. This paper asks: Why did those people live in that neighborhood at that time? I argue that white Americans racialized certain spaces under the conceptual framework of Indian Country as part of the process of American conquest on the northern plains, creating continuities between policies of removal, the institution of the reservation system and twentieth-century urban segregation. The American project of racializing western spaces erased Indians from histories of Rapid City. The importance of a tourism industry rooted in white conquest narratives to the regions economy played an important role in keeping Indians out of urban spaces. Despite this, Indians continued to live and work in the city, particularly after the imposition of the federal policies of termination and relocation. In Rapid City restrictive housing laws and rampant discrimination forced Native Americans in Rapid City to live in poor neighborhoods cut off from city services, including one neighborhood along Rapid Creeks floodplain. After the flood, activists retook the concept of Indian Country as a tool of protest.

The deployment of citizen to describe membership within the body politic of America was an apparent holdover from the Articles of Confederation, which mentions the status once. While the Constitution mentions citizenship a number of times, it fails to include a definition of the status or who is considered a citizen. To this day, the status lacks an official legal definition. This paper puts forth that while the Constitution does not explicitly define citizenship, it is possible to come to certain conclusions about it. I examine the text of the Constitution, the legal and constitutional history of slavery preceding the convention, and broader cultural understandings about race, slavery, and freedom, to come to a conclusion about what citizenship was. By looking at the intersections of law, politics, and culture, I conclude that it was commonly understood, even if not vocalized, that black Americans would never be considered citizens. In other words, I take seriously Chief Justice Roger Taneys opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford where his racists ramblings of black inferiority and the Founding Fathers has largely been written off as illegitimate. Instead, I ask what would the creation of the U.S. state through the Constitution, and the development of citizenship, look like if we take Taney at his word?

Though their list of objectionable music spanned many genres and artists, their attack on popular music in the 1980s gradually zeroed in on heavy metal as their primary target. Though they promoted themselves as simply a group of concerned mothers, the founders of the PMRC were, in reality, the wives of prominent Washington politicians who used their clout to wage war against heavy metal, one of the decades most popular and profitable musical genres. Benefitting from an increasing public concern over Satanism and child abuse, the PMRC capitalized on a culture of fear to gain support for their cause. Their efforts culminated in a 1985 Senate hearing that brought heavy metal music and heavy metal culture into the national spotlight—contributing to an overwhelmingly negative perception of the genre among mainstream Americans. As one of the most heavily publicized battles in a series of culture wars waged by conservatives in the 1980s, the PMRCs attack on heavy metal revealed tensions inherent in conservative ideology as the unrestricted free market, considered essential by many fiscal conservatives, bred the very excesses that social conservatives sought to contain.</p>","Were Not Gonna Take It: The Parents Music Resource Centers Crusade Against Heavy Metal"

These balls, limited to white men and light-skinned free quadroon women, became an interracial rendezvous that provided evening entertainment and the possibility of forming sexual liaisons in exchange for financial sponsorship. The infamous Quadroon Ball became just one of many spaces in which Louisianas free women of color forged both intimate and economic ties with white men in the antebellum era. This paper examines the ways some free women of color engaged in intimate labor. In the face of precarious freedom and limited opportunities, free women of color pursued economic security. To do so, some engaged in sex across the color line as they attempt to access capital and limited power. This paper will explore the intimate choices made by these women. Drawing on business and notarial records as well as court cases, this paper will use individual stories of free women of color to illuminate larger patterns and themes in the intimate labors of this population. I argue that despite the significant financial limitations placed on free women of color, they drew on their business acumen to benefit monetarily from their sexual relationships. They leveraged the various forms of capital (financial, social, and racial) they gained through their intimate relationships and labors with white men, and some women even amassed significant wealth.</p>","Whats Love Got To Do With It?

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, he worked first for the Hudsons Bay Company and then the American Fur Company and later became a Methodist preacher. In 1823 Fahlstrom married Margaret Bonga, an African Ojibwe woman from a prominent fur trade family. In countless narratives depicting Fahlstroms immigration first from Stockholm to Canada, and then from Canada into the region known today as Minnesota, the life of Fahlstroms wife has been astonishingly obscured in the shadows. Margaret Bonga Fahlstrom, who was married to Fahlstrom for over 35 years, has a fascinating story of her own that provides meaningful insight into regional and global history. In St. Paul–the capital of Minnesota–are public monuments memorializing Jacob Fahlstrom, signaling public remembrance of him. But how has his wifes role and identity been remembered? What is the significance of publicly forgetting her? Margaret Bongas role in the narratives of local regional history is largely ignored while focus has been steadfastly maintained on Jacob. Without Margaret, however, it is unlikely that he would have secured the work or achieved the social positions that have drawn the attention of historians, scholars, and the general public. This paper looks at how settler colonial narratives shaped the historiography to marginalize Margaret Bongas story and to erase her as a woman of African ancestry. Using this couple as a focus point, I consider the intersections of the fields of early immigration history, Native American history, and public history and memory.</p>","Where Is The Bonga Family In Immigration History?

Rap Browns trial for inciting a riot was to convene the following day. Almost immediately, state and federal authorities, including J. Edgar Hoover, declared that Featherstone and Payne had blown themselves up and cast their deaths as part of a broader wave of bombings instigated by radicals. Although a wide swath of civil rights figures challenged this explanation and demanded an in-depth investigation into the bombing, none was forthcoming. Several scholars, from Clayborne Carson to Akinyele Umoja, have touched on Feathersones death but, to date, none have investigated it thoroughly or placed it in the context of broader efforts to neutralize the black left. Building on previously classified documents, this paper will explore the states and the medias role in Featherstones death. There can be little doubt that state officials resisted launching a thorough investigation of the bombing, lest it lead to questions about its repressive efforts. Concomitantly, the national media, often cast as a defender of civil liberties and rights, served as an accomplice. Carl Bernstein, soon of Watergate fame, wrote the Washington Posts initial story on the bombing but pursued the story no further despite clear flaws in the states explanation. And numerous prominent journalists fed the frame up that Featherstone was an out-of-control revolutionary who had blown himself up.</p>","Who Killed Ralph Featherstone?

But the story of Social Security features only experts because its story tellers have only been concerned with experts. Indeed, Derthick excused the absence of Social Securitys recipients in her narrative by asserting that it is possible to appraise the making of public choices without detailed knowledge of the subjects of choice. This is not so, and excluding ordinary Americans from American social policy history was a choice not a matter of fact.My paper reorients the foundation laid by scholars of American political development to explore the ways Social Security recast citizens relationships to the state after World War II. When we look at the social history of Social Security, we find congressional representatives addressing the minute financial ramifications of legislation with citizens who were demanding answers from their leaders. Hundreds of letters regarding Social Security fill the files of postwar elected officials—thousands more can be found in the files of committee chairmen who oversaw major legislation throughout the 1950s. Even as the state became more technocratic, more expert driven, and ultimately less democratic in many areas of policy, Social Securitys expansion was demanded and watched over carefully by ordinary citizens.

The political economy of urban crisis excluded a generation of black youth from waged employment while at the same time criminalizing their participation in the informal economy. In Detroit, young people responded to these circumstances by developing an innovative approach to heroin sales utilizing juveniles, a development most closely associated with a group called Young Boys, Inc. These young boys posed a challenge to the administrations of the first generation of African American mayors in large American cities. Elected in the aftermath of urban insurrection, many had a mandate to implement wide-ranging police reforms. For Coleman Young, Detroits young boys created unforeseen difficulties in carrying out this political project. Rather than recognizing this emerging cohort of young people as a challenge to how capitalism structured economic inequality by race in urban spaces, and hence an attempt to redefine what counted as crime, the fabrication of order amid urban crisis criminalized that participation. This paper functions as a cohort biography of the young people involved in Detroits informal economy at this time, told through court records and vernacular texts that circulated in the city. By exploring the spatial, emotional, economic, and linguistic experiences of these young boys as they encountered the citys penal institutions, this paper reveals the emergence of a new urban subject that posed a profound challenge to attempts to govern the nations cities during the carceral era.</p>","Young Boys: A Cohort Biography Of Detroits Informal Economy During The Carceral Era"

In recent decades, scholars of childhood such as Steven Mintz (2003) and Anna Mae Duane (2013) have pioneered the use of age as a major category of analysis for understanding the formation of American politics, society, and culture. This paper extends this initiative by applying age as a category of analysis to the rise of religious reform activity, using the creation of youth leadership networks within Sunday schools in the first half of the nineteenth century as a case study. The paper analyzes how Sunday school promoters harnessed the spread of romanticized reconstructions of age to establish physical and imagined communities of faith exclusively for young people. This in turn offered youth new avenues for pursing religious activity, most significantly by enabling them to serve as Sunday school teachers. Providing adolescents with this unprecedented opportunity for assuming religious authority enabled young people to participate in the national expansion of the Protestant community in their own right, turning these youth leadership networks into a self-sustaining source of reformist energy that helped power the machine of voluntarism across the nation. By highlighting this synergistic relationship between childhood, youth, and voluntarism, this paper demonstrates that shifting intellectual discourses about age combined with religious beliefs to undergird the impulse toward social reform in the early republic, helping propel the growth of American Protestantism and contributing to the formation of American national identity.</p>","Youth Networks In Early Nineteenth-Century American Religious Culture: Employing Age As A Category Of Analysis For Religious And Intellectual Histories"

Zorro has been a staple in U.S. popular culture since 1919 and reached his zenith in the 1950s thanks to a lavish Walt Disney television show. That version, like most others, set Zorros exploits in 1820s Los Angeles on the eve of the United States arrival. Wealthy hacendado Diego Vega disguises himself as the titular character to thwart colonial officials who rob the missions and mistreat the poor. Although childrens entertainment, Disneys Zorro laid bare a tension between the Latino heros devotion to social justice and conservative uneasiness around contemporary civil rights movements. Zorros mission to end the oppression of Californias poor mestizos and native peoples seemingly struck uncomfortably close to 1950s activists who pressured local and federal governments to end racial discrimination. This paper charts the reworking of the character over the series run in that context. Disneys hero initially sought justice for Californias racially heterogeneous populations; but by season 2 was recast as a defender of law and order. This culminated in a multiepisode story arc in which Zorro quashes a group of revolutionary mestizo peons. Zorro dismisses their calls for social justice with a demand that they have faith in their government. Zorros transformation from protorevolutionary to a one-man police force provides an unexpected source for considering 1950s anxieties around civil rights.</p>","Zorro Defends The Status Quo: Disneys Ambivalent Hero In The Civil Rights Era"

Patriots saw such inconsistency as proof that Quakers had made religion a cloak for the rankest toryism, and conscience a plea to avoid those duties, the performance of which reflect the greatest honour on human nature. (Belisarius, Pennsylvania Packet, Aug. 15, 1778). In fact, the theological position of Quakers and other peace churches in Pennsylvania had shifted and hardened over the course of the eighteenth century in no small part due to their experiences during the earlier colonial wars, and, particularly, the collapse of the colonys earlier, less adversarial approach to Indian relations (an effort in which the Quakers had served as leaders). This paper will look at the debates within the Pennsylvania Quaker communities in the 1739–1764 period, particularly regarding the Quaker efforts to serve as mediators between the colonies and the Pennsylvania Indian groups, as well as the Quaker response to the French and Indian War and Paxton uprising, to explain the theological shift that resulted in the Pennsylvania Quaker Meetings refusal to accept any accommodation with the oaths, taxes and militia service demanded of them during the revolution.</p>","A Cloak Of Rankist Toryism: Quakers And War In 18th-Century Pennsylvania"

When the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints colonized the Great Basin in the late 1840s, the Mormons attempted to create a communitarian independent economy. Church leaders urged women to boycott non-Mormon merchants and dedicate their free time to silk production. This directive emerged from heated debates over plural marriage. Critics condemned polygamous patriarchs for treating their wives like Indian squaws and depriving them of fashionable clothing. The silk experiment responded to the intense racialized politicization of womens bodies and desires. Beautiful, homemade fabric would allow the Latter-day Saints to shore up the communitys economic borders while still performing white, middle-class respectability. Mormon women responded to the sericulture directive with a mix of enthusiasm and disgust. They opened rooms in their homes to silkworms and constructed cocooneries on their property. They presented their goods at fairs, formed official organizations, constructed a reeling factory in Salt Lake City, and visited silk experiments in France and Italy. They reluctantly placed silkworm eggs underneath their pillows to catalyze hatching. This venture supported the church&quot;s economic infrastructure while also expanding the churchs colonial apparatus. Women from the Pacific Islands participated in the industry as part of their conversion. Mormon women, typically depicted as cloistered and entirely dependent on church patriarchs, operated in a wide economic sphere that linked the Great Basin to the international marketplace and contributed to the colonization of the Great Basin. Mormon women imbued silk with complex, at times conflicting meaning and significance based on these experiences.</p>","A Gold Mine In Embryo: Mormon Women, Silk Work, And Transnational Business In The Nineteenth-Century American West"

Using archival records from the Barings, Bank of England, Bank of the United States (BUS) Jardine Matheson, and Russell and Company archives, it argues that the large-scale capitalization of opium contracts into bills of exchange did, indeed, expose the transatlantic financial system to the vagaries of the Asian opium economy, turning Chinas drug crisis into a financial contagion. Starting in 1828, the BUS began to sell bills on London as a convenient means for East Indian opium traders to remit their profits back to London, and for American merchants to pay for Chinese wares. These bills, however, soon proved to be a liability for their holders, especially when the existential status of the trades principal product—opium—threatened to vanish with prohibition. By investigating the linkages between the Opium War and the 1839 Panic, this paper offers two historiographical contributions. First, it recasts the relationship between drugs and the history of capitalism by highlighting the significance of the opium trade in the development of modern financial markets. Second, by analyzing the connections between Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Canton, London and Calcutta merchants, it reconfigures the geographies of financial dependency in the Jacksonian era in a groundbreaking fashion.</p>","A Marvellous Affair: The Opium War And The Panic Of 1839"

To her, presidential and local elections on November 2, 1920 represented the potential for southern black women to gain a place at the front ranks, so she organized other black women in Florida to challenge white supremacy and violence by voting for candidates who would halt Ku Klux Klan violence. From the time she arrived in Daytona, Florida, in 1904 to her presidency of the Southeastern Federation of Colored Womens Clubs in 1920, Bethune worked with African Americans, her students, and white moderates in her advocacy for citizenship and voting rights.  Yet her tactics often failed beyond Daytonas city limits. In this paper, I argue that Bethunes early strategies led to her belief in 1935 that a national organization such as the National Council of Negro Women and her fight for black womens roles in Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelts New Deal in 1936 were indispensable for political rights.

That international context in turn became a source of pressure for political leaders seeking to establish a federal system of education in the United States. Citing France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, Austria, and Japan, Senator Henry Blair in 1887 warned that other nations were accelerating their pace in mass education while the U.S. pace was stagnant or declining.  Great Britain, which once lagged in school provisions, had established a national system and extended it to every vacant lot on the globe.  Wherever Great Britain sends her ships she carries her institutions and her laws, Blair explained, with the result that she had now annexed the world.  Scholars of U.S. political economy and government have largely ignored education as a domain of national policy-making in the late nineteenth century.  Arguably, however, education played a more central role in how leaders imagined the nations future during this period than it had before or has since.  Drawing on national reports and congressional debates, as well as on analysis of the politics and structure of schooling in U.S. states and territories, this paper builds upon literature on U.S. political economy and politics to illuminate the significance of education as national and imperial policy in a competitive global economy from 1876 to 1907.</p>","Annexing The World:   Education As National And Imperial Policy In A Competitive Global Economy, 1876–1907"

Under the previous law, objectors had to be members of historic peace churches, but the 1940 act required only that an individual object to all war because of his religious training and belief. This vague phrase led to thousands of difficult cases, and many mens applications were denied. Many of them sought legal help to navigate the complex appeals process, and a number of organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), provided aide and counsel. A few cases reached the federal appeals courts, and the Second and Ninth Circuits issued contradictory interpretations in <i>United States v.&nbsp;Kauten </i>(1943) and <i>Berman v. United States&nbsp;</i>(1946), respectively. In 1948 Congress amended the draft act to clarify its language.This paper analyzes the collaborations and contestations that led to these pivotal cases. It shows how petitioners, their lawyers, and peace organizations worked together with and against the military, the Department of Justice, federal investigators, and the courts to make law together. The paper focuses on the landmark cases of Mathias Kauten and Herman Berman, analyzing them as well as their correspondences with the ACLUs National Committee on Conscientious Objectors and the committees private memoranda about the cases. These materials are restricted and confidential until 2020, so this work will bring new perspectives and sources to the Kauten and Berman cases, which set the terms of debate for new legislation and major conscientious objection cases in the Vietnam War era.</p>","Call It Conscience Or God: Defining Religious Belief, 1940–1948"

Though the remnants of their performances are few and far between, how their fellow inmates appreciated them can still be found in The Opal, the asylums patient-edited journal, published from 1851 through 1860. While historians, such as Benjamin Reiss, who looked at The Opal and the meanings of Blackbird Minstrels performances draw our attention to the power struggle and class dynamics in the institutional environment, the ways gender and race intersect to create more complicated human dynamics in the asylum has not been fully explored. This paper examines the ways Blackbird Minstrels embodied the convoluted moments of racial and gender crossings within the institutional walls. Onstage, performing the colored subjects who spoke, smiled, and sang in crazier ways, the already crazed patient performers were enabled to mask their own pathologized, incarcerated, and ultimately othered bodies and instead masquerade as those whose bodies were equally, and quite unequally, oppressed, negotiated, and perpetually othered—African Americans. This paper argues that Blackbird Minstrels appropriation of blackness gestured toward the juncture where the boundaries between race, gender, and mental illness are drawn and redrawn, the social, sexual, and pathological labels rehierarchized, and their disability made hypervisible in subversive ways.</p>","Colored And Crazed: Blackface Minstrelsy And Identity Crossing In The New York State Lunatic Asylum"

The public, mixed-gender interactions that defined these womens leisure and labor constituted a distinct intimate economy that intersected with the well-documented culture of working-class womens labor and mens leisure. Activities such as communal drinking, physical violence, commercial sex, stage entertainment, and thievery all involved womens physical activity or bodily contact with other women and men in closely situated spaces such as saloons, brothels, and city streets. Intimate, then, describes both the physicality of interactions and the nearness of institutions. Furthermore, the intimate economy relied on the exchanges facilitated by public women—whether prostitutes, leisure workers, or thieves—who embodied and performed a transgressive femininity that subverted gender expectations and exploited interactions with men to secure income. Public women also frequently and visibly transgressed the spatial boundaries among public and private institutions of the intimate economy to conduct business and engage in leisure. Although public womens economic activity rarely translated into expanded wealth, it did provide the foundation for ward bosses to secure personal fortunes and political power as they presided over a decentralized political economy. Reading against homicide records, newspaper accounts, and surveillance from turn-of-the-century reformers provides an opportunity to center womens economic choices and gender behavior and reveal their critical role in conducting the foundational transactions of a broader political economy.</p>","Constant Riot And Effervescence: Chicagos Intimate Economy, 1871–1909"

While some scholars contend that human capital displaced policy concerns with equity, this paper historicizes that process and argues that many policy advocates used human capital strategically to address social inequalities. They persuaded politicians that the economic future of cities and states depended on greater investment in human resources, but not until the 1990s did they look to human capital to guide policy for K–12 and higher education. Using North Carolina as a case study, this paper draws on governors personal and state archives, the records of nonprofit policy organizations, annual gubernatorial meetings, documents, oral history interviews, and press accounts to reconstruct how politicians and their advisors drew from ideas of human capital starting in the 1960s. They initially saw in human capital a capacious rationale for education spending writ large—whether in primary, secondary, or tertiary schools—one with bearing on budgets but not on policy otherwise. By the early 1980s, in conjunction with education reform typically marked by the report <i>A Nation at Risk</i>, many governors, especially southern governors, centered tenetsof human capital theory in their public rationales for investment in education, or, as North Carolina governor James B. Hunt called it, education for economic growth. Bill Clinton brought this approach to the White House in the 1990s, by which point policymakers looked to human capital for more concrete policy guidance, facilitating the testing and privatization agendas.</p>","Education For Economic Growth: The Political Uses Of Human Capital In The Late 20th Century"

Since even a few pounds of material could be extremely valuable, workers devised ingenious methods to pilfer from the walls, veins, and muck of the mines. The practice of miners stealing ore was called high grading, and it was rife in Goldfield in the first decade of the twentieth century. Miners claimed this was a just perquisite of their labor. Corporate bosses viewed it as larceny. Others joined the fight. U.S. marshals chased suspected high-graders across the state, legislators raced to tighten restrictions, journalists denounced the practice, and even union leaders tried to rein in their members. But the miners saw it differently. Laboring in perilous workscapes and living in brutal conditions, they understood the theft of high-grade ore to be morally sacrosanct—and not a crime at all. Scholars have explored the impact of mining labor on workers bodies and their consciousness, but an examination of the practice of high-grading offers a new perspective on the ways workers fashioned a distinct class-based vision of property rights when it came to natural resources. Defying capitalists assertions of ownership, refusing to collaborate in the vision promoted by middle-class publicists and boosters that the mining camp was a unified community, the workers of Goldfield staked their own claims to the wealth of nature.</p>","Gold Belongs To Him Who Finds It: Theft, Property Rights, And Nevadas High-Grading Controversy, 1905–1907"

Wealthier Quakers were the fathers and mothers of the Holy Family that was the Society of Friends. They were told to nurture and support both their own children and all those in the Society who had fewer resources. Philanthropy was thus central to the faith. The support that wealthy Quakers provided helped the sect survive and flourish, but it also meant that the Society relied on the largesse of members whose wealth was often generated through participation in the Atlantic slave system. This paper traces the multigenerational philanthropy of one sugar plantation–owning Quaker family, the Langford-Redwoods, to argue that wealthy slave-owning Quakers were central to the survival and growth of Quakerism. Jonas Langford played a key role in enabling the survival of the Quaker community in the Caribbean in the seventeenth century. By the eighteenth century, though, the Society of Friends was economically successful enough that they no longer needed to prioritize supporting only those within their faith. Abraham Redwood, who inherited his familys plantation, used his wealth to endow the secular Redwood Library in Newport, Rhode Island. After the American Revolution decimated the wealth of the New England Quaker community however, Redwood returned to supporting the sect of his birth, endowing the New England Yearly Meeting School. By then, however, he had been disowned for refusing to free his 200-some slaves.</p>","Good Quakers: The Redwood-Langford Family, Philanthropy, And The Atlantic Slave System"

This position lends itself to the foregone conclusion of African gullibility and servitude. The phrase slaves couldnt read reinforces the notion that enslaved Africans had no knowledge of the complexity of written language forms and their social utility. Unfortunately, much of what has been taught about the enslavement of African people suggests that the entire enslaved population arrived with no literary history. This historical fallacy is the result of the misuse of history as propaganda to support a narrative that enslaved Africans—and thus their descendants—were incapable of cognitive processes. Contrary to this false narrative is the truth that many enslaved Africans used literacy as a tool to secure not only their freedom but also the freedom of others—particularly through armed enslaved insurrection. On many occasions, individuals who led armed enslaved insurrections were literate members of enslaved communities. The point that these individuals were literate is often made in passing while focusing on other factors such as bitterness and acts of violence that influenced conspiracies to rebel against chattel slavery. The purpose of this research is to illustrate the impact of literacy on the efficacy of three insurrections in 1800, 1822 and 1831. I argue that literacy played a pivotal role in the construction of ideals of freedom not only for leaders themselves but for their enslaved kin as well.</p>","Great Influence On My Mind: The Impact Of Literacy On Armed Enslaved Insurrections"

Drawing upon a wide range of archival sources including government and movement records, interviews with policy makers and activists, and journalistic and secondary sources, this paper documents how the governments campaign against these domestic movements was an extension of its policy of counterrevolution in Central America, adding to our understanding of the dynamic relationship between foreign policy, international migration, social movements, and state repression. Revolution and counterrevolution in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala drove approximately 1 million Central Americans to seek refuge in the United States during the 1980s. The Reagan administration granted asylum to only a tiny fraction of the Salvadoran and Guatemalan asylum seekers, even as it advanced a foreign policy that fueled the violence that drove the Central American exodus. In response, activists in North America created the sanctuary movement to offer refuge to those fleeing U.S.-backed violence, partnering closely with a Central American solidarity movement that sought to expose and obstruct U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua and to the military and paramilitary forces in El Salvador and Guatemala. Because the sanctuary and Central American movements challenged the U.S. governments ability to carry out its foreign policy objectives openly, the government attempted to destroy these movements by employing a public relations and legal campaign against them, and covertly through a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation of surveillance and intimidation.</p>","History Will Hold Us Accountable: Counter-Revolution In Central America And The Reagan Administrations Campaign Against The Sanctuary Movement"

Abolition And Radical Isms Of The Nineteenth Century</h5></p><p>Historians have long argued that the nativist Know-Nothings were essentially a Northern Party. They have generally accepted W. Darrell Overdykes argument in <i>The Know-Nothing Party in the South</i> (1950)—that southern nativism was never more than lukewarm and that southerners seized upon the issue primarily as an opportunity to avoid the long-debated and touchy issues of slavery and state rights. It was unionism rather than nativism that motivated Know-Nothings in the immigrant-poor South.This paper argues that such a characterization draws a false dichotomy between southern nativism and unionism in the 1850s. In an 1852 speech that would be remembered as something like a prophecy of the upheavals that followed, John Bell of Tennessee issued a powerful warning about the dangers of immigrants and their radical ideas to the Union. Years before he joined the Know-Nothings, Bells spotlighted in his speech the interconnectedness of southern nativism, unionism, and conservatism in the 1850s.The great American question of the times, Bell warned, was whether the ultraisms that animated (and, he was sure, doomed) the European revolutions of 1848 would destroy the institutions and traditions of the American republic. The proliferation of radical isms was evidence of the spread of these foreign ideas about universal equality, the most alarming of which was abolitionism. He saw it as a bellwether of radicalism more generally, and the dangers he associated with it—anarchy, chaos, and violence—portended the destruction that awaited if the advance of such wild, foreign ideas continued unabated.</p>","It Must Be The Ultraisms: John Bell, Conservatism, And Foreign Radicalism, 1852"

Since World War I, the goal of the&nbsp; VA has been to return veterans to employment and has focused on lost limbs as the source of unemployment or lost wages.  The wounds of war were turned into a system to measure how much ability to labor had been lost as a result of wartime service.  That system has produced a language and shared identities among veterans.  Im 75–80 Percent Disabled, is how one Vietnam War veteran introduced himself.  The number is a disability ranking, a subtraction from the 100% able-bodied whole person, the VA explains.  Veterans compare percentages—Im 10%; 60%; Finally, Im 100%.  They compare, complain, exult.  They fill out forms, gather evidence, consult lawyers.  Percentages equal disability rankings equals dollars.  Vets identify as percentages of disability.  But when they receive these rankings—and monthly checks—do they see themselves as a person with disabilities?This paper investigates the VAs system of denying, then addressing the health effects of Agent Orange and what that bureaucratic system meant(and means) to veterans.  Successfully obtaining a desired disability ranking apparently represents respect—as men, soldiers, and citizens.  For some Vietnam veterans, disability benefits also appear to serve as just compensation for the social rejection they felt at wars end.

The advice he gives in the series of essays on manly diet, exercise, and appearance, prescribe a daily regimen of seemingly random and at times contradictory performances of masculinity. The instructions range from growing beards to wearing cotton socks and athletic shoes to always walking with an expanded breast. More important than the advice given, I argue, is Whitmans claim that men need to subject themselves to a visible, minutely detailed, and infinitely repetitive regimen to demonstrate their successful control over their bodies. Whitman wrote the series at a time when power relations in the United States were shifting from an elite-run system to a middle-class driven culture. Disciplinary regimens of masculinity such as the one Whitman proposed and that were written for a mass audience served to legitimize white middle-class mens claim to power. The will to self-improve—manifest in Whitmans bodily ideals of facial hair, muscle, and health—was meant to demonstrate the readiness of white, middle-class men to demand greater political participation, and to take over new social responsibilities. Thus, manly advice illustrated an early understanding of being self-made, linking the disciplinary body practices to financial success and social power. Simultaneously, as I will show, it demonstrates the vulnerability of a hegemonic masculinity that needed to be inscribed on the body in interminable repetition.</p>","Let Nothing Divert You From The Duty To Your Body: Walt Whitmans Advice On Manliness"

Building off of the relationship Pulido traces between the racialization embedded within the space of Los Angeles and the development of radical politics among various minoritized populations, this paper seeks to explore LaFayette Park, Washington D.C., and Bethesda, Maryland, as sites for two simultaneous processes after the Iranian Revolution: first, the practiced racialization and criminalization of Iranians in the United States, and, second, the articulation of communities of resistance within the diaspora. The postrevolutionary protests in LaFayette Park, I argue, occurred when the racialization of Iranians in America was the most salient in the 20th century. In particular, I examine the Iran Freedom Foundation, an anti-Khomeini political organization, and the Iranian Students Association, a radical Marxist organization, as they articulate a national and racial identity by claiming whiteness and brownness, respectively, through practices of protest in LaFayette Park and community formation in Bethesda. Through the use of archival documents from the Hoover Institution and the National Archives, this paper argues that these spaces in the Washington, D.C., area were crucial to the formation and factionalism of the Iranian diasporic community, in the face of external threat and criminalization by U.S. institutions and private citizens alike.</p>","Long Live A Sovereign And Self-Sufficient Iran: Lafayette Park And Bethesda, Maryland, As Sites Of Iranian Diasporic Racialization And Resistance, 1978–1988"

Mortons language focused on gently winning over white racists. Yet the work camps she organized took a structural rather than individual approach to white racism. She prioritized relationships with local black community members even as she tried to win over whites. At first modeled on camps run by the peace churches during the interwar years, her camps emphasized interracial cohabitation as key to cultivating Christian community. They also explicitly supported economic cooperatives and other programs designed to circumvent or undermine the racialized capitalist economy of the South. The work camps adopted an egalitarian racial and economic model that Fellowship members deemed an essential feature of genuine Christian community and a blueprint for a more just economic system. Yet their model of an alternative southern economy, their examples of racial and economic justice, proved neither persuasive nor replicable in the Souths entrenched Jim Crow economies. Even as members of the Fellowship of Southern Churchmen recognized that southern communities must play a role in their own transformation, their membership—always predominantly white, male, middle-class, and Protestant—replicated the Souths white supremacist hierarchy.

Male strangers have harassed women with uninvited sexual remarks, stares, and touching since womens first prolonged entrance into urban public space in the antebellum period. This paper examines a period when Americans contested the meaning of these intrusive behaviors, now popularly known as street harassment. Womens groups and law enforcement denounced street harassment in the Progressive Era, arguing it impeded womens mobility in public space. However, as campaigns for gender equality, suffrage, and sexual liberalism began to shift ideas about gender and sexuality in the early twentieth century, popular discourse increasingly characterized street harassment as trivial, harmless flirtation. By the 1930s, commentators across the country ridiculed the implication that American women needed protection from something as harmless as a leering glance or shouted come-on. Through an examination of newspaper reports, advice literature, popular culture, and womens writings, this paper argues that public discourses in the United States steadily normalized catcalling, ogling, and other forms of street harassment in the 1930s and 1940s. In particular, it traces how the intrusive behaviors that had outraged Progressive Era reformers came to be thought of as the right of white, middle-class men by midcentury. In so doing, this paper will consider the impact of typical forms of sexual harassment that, while prevalent, are often perceived as normal and thus benign.</p>","Most Girls Want Boys To Whistle At Them!: Normalizing Street Harassment In The United States, 1930–1945"

It argues that successful campaigns in these years understood women to be important swing voters and actively pursued their votes, contrary to history and political science scholarship that either suggests or explicitly states that national politicians ignored women as a distinct group of voters from the late 1920s until the late 1960s or early 1970s. Midcentury campaigns produced postcards, fliers, and radio programs that specifically targeted female voters. This material, however, addressed more than womens issues. Whether one understands womens issues to mean feminist issues such as the equal rights amendment or maternalist concerns such as programs for women and children or international peace, campaign media targeting women went beyond those topics. Maternalist concerns were certainly present, but they were not the only issues campaigns used to secure womens votes. Dwight D. Eisenhower stated in 1958 that he did not believe there was a womans angle to the great issues of our day, and his predecessors in the Oval Office appear to have agreed with that assessment. This paper will explore this tension—between media produced specifically for women, on the one hand, and statements that posited there was no distinct womans angle, on the other—and argue that politicians in this era had a complicated, even contradictory understanding of women as voters but that they never ignored those female votes.

Born in Les Cayes, Haiti as Francois Lubin in 1957, Saint moved to New York City in 1970 and published fiction writing, essays, and plays that critiqued state violence against Black queer people and documented his experience living with AIDS as a Haitian immigrant. Scholars in anthropology, English, French, and gender and sexuality studies have recovered Saint as a key figure in AIDS activist circles in the U.S. However, it has been acknowledged that Saints work has fallen out of popularity since his death in 1994 except in primarily literary venues. As such, historians in particular have yet to fully examine the generative capacity of Saints work as a form of knowledge production about HIV/AIDS. Drawing on histories of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and U.S. LGBTQ history, I argue that Saints work constitutes a form of AIDS writing that contributed to knowledge production about AIDS during a time of state-sanctioned silence and repression. Saints essays offer critical commentary on the state neglect of Black queer people living with AIDS and might suggest a re-reading of dominant narratives regarding the legibility of certain political responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. I close read sections of Saints essay entitled, Sacred Life in which he theorizes the intersections of race, sexuality, and HIV/AIDS in response to the silence surrounding the epidemic.</p>","Our Poems As Weapons Of Survival: Assotto Saint And The Poetics And Politics Of Aids Writing"

Feminists began organizing self-defense training sessions, establishing rape crisis centers, and advocating for reforms in rape crisis care and rape law throughout the United States. By the mid-1970s, womens liberation feminists and their allies in academic, legal, and medical professions began addressing the problem of sexual violence on American college campuses, developing programs to serve students and people who lived near campus. Simultaneously, a particularly divisive movement emerged from womens liberation feminism. Antipornography feminists understood pornography and sadomasochism to promote violence against women, believing pornography should be strictly regulated or eliminated altogether by the state. Other feminists pushed back. They accused the antipornography movement of having myopic and dated views of sexuality, stripping women of their sexual agency, and encouraging censorship. While feminists on both sides of the debate agreed on the importance of antiviolence projects, their disagreements over danger and pleasure in sex provoked the feminist sex wars of the late 1970s and early 1980s. What role did these distinct cultural politics of violence play in antiviolence work on American college campuses? This paper discusses how activism and theorizing on either side of the sex wars were intermeshed with campus anti-violence organizing. Focusing on the Barnard Center for Research on Women and Catharine MacKinnon, I show how divergent understandings of sexual violence shaped the development of policies and programs to address sexual misconduct on American college campuses.</p>","Pleasure And Danger: The Feminist Sex Wars And Responses To Sexual Violence On American College Campuses"

In 1977 an entire book was published on the craze, stating: Redneck chic has arrived…City slickers from north, south, east and west are climbing on the buckboard. From New York City to Los Angeles, and from Minneapolis to Miami, its chic to be hick. In cities around the country, white urbanites increasingly adopted signifiers of rural fashion and culture, wearing cowboy boots, Levis denim jackets, and, of course, listening to country music. But as one article questioned, Where does all of this love of rural music come from among people who have never lived in the country and whose fathers and mothers were born in Brooklyn? By 1980, this trend exploded into the urban cowboy craze that made country music more popular than ever before.My paper considers why and how it became increasingly fashionable for urban Americans with middle-to-upper class incomes to embrace the cultural markers of a mythic rural life-style in the 1970s. I am particularly interested in the role these listeners played in cementing the genres whiteness at a time of unprecedented racial diversity among country musics artists (both African American and Mexican American artists found mainstream success in country music during this period). By 1979, two-thirds of country music listeners resided in urban and suburban areas and a similar amount earned either middle or high incomes.  The country music industry capitalized on the buying power of these demographics and sold them on a version of country music that paradoxically drew influence from disco—a genre that celebrated racial and sexual diversity—while maintaining the optics and gender norms of white rusticity. My paper will explore the unequal contradiction of why these advantaged Americans without discernible rural roots were embraced by the music industry as country music consumers, and nonwhite, rural-born artists were ostracized from the genre by the end of the decade. I situate Redneck Chic within a number of historical factors, including the white ethnic movement, a widespread interest in genealogy and ancestral heritage among Americans, the 1976 bicentennial celebration, and the election of Jimmy Carter. At a time of heightened awareness about ones roots, I argue that country music was invoked as mythic but accepted evidence of a purely white American heritage and emerged as a cornerstone of Reagan-era conservatism.</p>","Redneck Chic: Racial Paradox In 1970s Country Music"

After several years of fraught relations between missionaries Marcus and Narcissa Whitman and local native communities, a group of five Cayuse men confronted the settlers one last time, killing both Marcus and Narcissa along with eleven others. The Whitmans deaths led many of their fellow settlers to retaliate against the Cayuse in an eight-year war and to celebrate the Whitmans as martyrs for the next century and a half. In 1940 the National Park Service established the Whitman Mission National Historic Site in Walla Walla, Washington, to promote and celebrate the memory of the Whitmans as pioneers and martyrs. For decades, native voices at the site were demonized and erased. But as local native communities, particularly the Cayuse and the larger Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, grew in economic and political power in the region, the narrative promoted at the site became much more complicated—one that openly challenged rather than endorsed the settler colonial narratives that led to the sites establishment. This paper traces these important shifts and reflects on the continued difficulty of decolonizing a space in which settler narratives of the pioneer spirit and missionary martyrdom are so deeply entrenched. While the Whitman site attempts to build a more complex understanding of the past, it must also face the remnants of the pioneer mythologies that continue to mark the space.</p>","Restoration, Reclaiming, Remembrance: Asserting Native Voice At The Whitman Mission National Historic Site"

Koreagate brought unprecedented attention to Korean Americans and raised questions about U.S. support for its longtime client, South Korea. Tong-sun Park, an agent for the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA), was at the heart of the affair. Park established himself within elite Washington circles during the 1960s—his dinner parties at the plush George Town Club earned him a reputation as the Asian Great Gatsby. Park began to lobby members of Congress as part of a campaign overseen by the KCIA to bolster U.S. support for Koreas military dictatorship. At the same time, KCIA agents intimidated and harassed Korean immigrants who spoke out against the Korean government. The targets of the KCIA often ran small businesses in ethnic enclaves around the city, far from the elegant settings where Park courted politicians and lobbyists. U.S. officials overlooked the suppression of Korean American antigovernment activism—it was only after Parks illicit lobbying efforts became publicized that any action was taken. By contrasting the lived experiences and treatment of Korean American dissidents with those of Park, this paper highlights how U.S. foreign policy influenced the racialization and regulation of immigrant communities. It argues that Cold War geopolitics played a critical role in how certain immigrants experienced Washington, and the United States more broadly. While opening the colluders of power, and comfort, for those that promoted its interests abroad, the U.S. state marginalized those who did not.</p>","The Asian Great Gatsby In The Capital: Tong-Sun Park, The Korean Central Intelligence Agency, And The Geopolitics Of Ethnic Lobbying In 1970s Washington, D.c."

Across these two years, dozens of the citys poor and working-class black youth were kidnapped and slain. As an unknown killer stalked some of Atlantas most vulnerable young people, tensions ran high—stoked by a news media infrastructure increasingly adherent to a twenty-four-hour news cycle. Many black Atlantans suspected that one or more white supremacists were responsible for the abductions and murders. They also expressed frustration with the citys African American political establishment (led by Mayor Maynard Jackson) for its inability to address head on the obvious racial and class dimensions of the slayings. Indeed, critics in Atlanta, nationwide, and globally believed the kidnappings and murders represented a merciless and savage genocide of Black youths, according to one activist. Because the Atlanta tragedies coincided with the triumph of a revanchist Reaganism, the Reverend Jesse Jackson called Atlanta a laboratory for national danger. Other observers from around the world compared developments in Atlanta to those seen in the lynching era of the 1920s and the classical phase of the black freedom struggle. The Capital of Fear—which takes its title from a term used in France to describe Atlanta during this period—explores conceptions of violence within the context of the Atlanta youth slayings. It situates the Atlanta kidnappings and killings within the immediate historical context—the late 1970s and early 1980s, a moment of intensifying white power organizing and violence—and within a longer lineage of antiblack violence and terrorism, both nationally and globally.</p>","The Capital Of Fear: The Atlanta Youth Murders And The Transnational Politics Of Racial Violence"

During the early 1960s, Wisconsin ecumenical religious coalitions collaborated to provide Latino communities with the educational, health, and social services denied them by state agencies. By the end of the decade, a rising brown power movement led by groups such as the Latin American Union for Civil Rights and the Young Lords challenged the predominately white-led clerical leadership of these organizations to confront disproportionate police harassment and surveillance of the citys Mexican American and Puerto Rican populations. Spurred on by Latino youths growing anger toward extralegal state violence and constant stop, frisk, and questioning tactics employed by city police, Latino organizations demanded that faith institutions support grassroots efforts to replace the citys police chief as well as direct their economic and social capital towards initiatives such as seminars for patrolmen on Latino culture and active recruitment of policemen of Latino descent. This paper contributes to a larger project calling for historians of Latino communities to understand the role of religion in midwestern and national Latino civil rights movements not just as an additive component of grassroots mobilization, but also as a constitutive aspect of broader mobilizations in the twentieth century. This paper draws from a larger project that examines how the movement and reordering of people, religion, and cultural practices drove the creation of spaces open to cross-cultural and transregional interactions in Latino Wisconsin during the twentieth century.</p>","The Cops Regard Us As The Enemy: Faith Institutions And Latino Activism Against Police Harassment In Civil Rights-Era Milwaukee"

The Republican governor Lloyd Lowndes of Maryland condemned the lynching and offered a reward for the arrest of the lynchers. The governor and the Republican party faced pressure from African American leaders in the state but, even though they were dependent upon the African American vote, they ignored the pressure from their African American constituents. Black Baltimorean lawyer W. Ashbie Hawkins, as well as other members of Baltimores African American legal community, took the lead in fighting against both lynchings and the loss of political power and influence. In that year alone, Hawkins had led a committee to petition the governor to issue a reward for the capture of lynchers and had filed a writ of mandamus to allow African American congressional candidates on the ballot. It was no coincidence that Baltimores black lawyers simultaneously fought for antilynching measures and political influence; for, as various historians have noted, lynchings and the myth of the black rapist were used as political tools by Redeemers and other white supremacists to bring about the disfranchisement of African Americans. Racial violence and the fear of violence was initially used to limit the African American vote; the myths of male African American sexual violence led to statutory disenfranchisement. White supremacists in Maryland attempted to follow this route, which was successful in other former slave states, but the multiple times the Poe Suffrage Amendment was voted on in the first decade of the twentieth century to disfranchise African Americans in Maryland were all unsuccessful. This research explores the successful antilynching and antidisnfranchisement activism of black Baltimore lawyers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In conjunction with the larger African American community, these lawyers pressured governors of Maryland and legislative bodies to change policies and procedures for the sake of preventing lynchings, combated the myth of the black rapist and white supremacists assertions concerning the unsuitability of African American men to partake in politics, and worked with immigrant communities in Baltimore to defeat the Poe Suffrage Amendment. While still facing tremendous racial animosity and prejudice, these lawyers enabled African Americans in Maryland to maintain the franchise and they contributed to a precipitous drop in lynchings in the state after the first decade of the twentieth century.</p>","The Partition Wall Between Him And Slavery: African American Lawyers Anti-Lynching And Anti-Disenfranchisement Activism In Maryland"

Nixon declared that the postwar period in international relations has ended. This assertion was the prologue to his announcement of a major reform to U.S. nation-building programs, his so-called new directions in foreign aid program. Over the next few years, Nixon battled with Congress over exactly what new directions the United States should take in its project to fight poverty and promote democracy around the world. This was the closest that American policy makers ever came to an existential debate about the United States nation-building program. This paper reveals how the shape of this debate—and its ultimate conclusion by the mid-1970s—was formed by deep anxieties about the proper role of the state in providing social welfare that have bedeviled the United States nation-building program from its origins in the immediate post–World War II moment to the present. This paper argues that examining the tug-of-war between executive and legislative branches over the new directions of nation building in the 1970s helps us discern the long shadow of the Vietnam War on not just U.S. foreign policy but also on American democracy.</p>","The Postwar Period Has Ended: Nation Building And The Fractured State"

Canadian-born Presbyterian minister John Robert McDowall was at the helm of this campaign. &quot;O, the harlots! How numerous!&quot; he once complained in his diary after encountering yet another house of ill-fame in the Five Points neighborhood. In New York, he found an eager community of like-minded crusaders to join him. Among McDowalls early allies was the Female Benevolent Society. Soon, however, the women of the society began to question McDowalls methods and tactics. Shady stories of mistreatment began coming out from the Magdalen House for reformed sex workers, which McDowall ran. In addition, the sensational publications McDowall regularly produced seemed too immodest in their attention-grabbing descriptions of the citys sexual depravity. Finally, there was the money the minister owed the society and had seemingly no intentions of paying back. In 1834, the society utilized the press to bring public charges against McDowall to the New York Presbytery, which found the minister guilty and dismissed him from his post. In their fight against McDowall, society members reasserted their social influence and reaffirmed their commitment to less scandalous, more traditional methods of fighting vice.</p>","The Sin Of Lewdness: How The New York Female Benevolent Society Brought Down A Fellow Moral Crusader"

Work, Race, And Ability In The History Of U.S. Capitalism Around 1900</h5></p><p>In the early twentieth century, economic theorists responded to the eras concerns about social progress and productivity by focusing on the economic benefits of health. With a reformulation of capital theory, Yale University economist Irving Fisher paired up with progressive reformers and nutritionists by pointing to the economic significance of bettering the health and working capacity of Americans. Fisher introduced the body as human capital that could yield income, and he suggested that people could and should increase the income value of their bodies. From this perspective, healthy eating and hygienic living were understood as investments into the body by which enterprising selves could do their bit to accumulate not only individual but collective capital. It is no coincidence that Fisher was the cofounder of the Race Betterment Foundation. The early twentieth-century conception of human capital can be understood as an economic version of the survival of the fittest idea that connected the self-responsibility of individuals with visions of white racial progress and prosperity. Peoples self-conduct became the focus of reform efforts and the scale for judging good citizenship. After all, allegedly self-induced illnesses and deficiencies were considered to pose an economic as well as racial burden on American society. The paper discusses conceptions of human capital in progressive America and shows how it shaped a racialized body that was marked by the constant improvement of income and life.</p>","The True Wealth Of Nations Is The Health Of Its Individuals: The Body Politics Of Early Human Capital Theory"

Although King George III soon experienced the colonists displeasure, Americans had long-blamed the Kings ministers in the British cabinet-council for the detested legislation that led to the Revolution. During the summer of 1787, the delegates at the Constitutional Convention rejected a number of proposals based on widespread Anglophobia. In particular, the delegates rejected Charles Cotesworth Pinckneys proposal to create a council for the president compromised of the department secretaries. Yet by 1793, President George Washington met with his cabinet several times per week to discuss diplomatic issues, constitutional questions, and domestic crises. This paper will explore the public response to the cabinet. Surprisingly, the public accepted the cabinet as an institution, but criticized specific secretaries when they acted too much like British ministers. For example, Democratic-Republicans criticized Alexander Hamilton for wielding too much power over the executive and interfering with Congress. These complaints reflected a concern that American secretaries were becoming dangerously British. By examining the public response to department secretaries through the lens of the cabinet, this paper will demonstrate how the British monarchy shaped the U.S. government and its relationship with the American people long after the end of the Revolutionary War. This interpretation merges literature on popular participation in politics with Atlantic studies that examine Anglo-American political culture and applies these approaches to the cabinet.</p>","The Unpopular Cause Of Anglomany Is Openly Laying Claim To Him: The Presidents Cabinet, The American Public, And The Long Shadow Of The British Monarchy"

W. D. Fard, the groups founder, preached black supremacy and taught that black men were created in the image of Allah. He also taught his converts a new racial history, wherein black men had ruled over whites for millions of years. This message, delivered in a period when black unemployment approached 50 percent, presented a religious narrative that defined them as masculine patriarchs—despite the fact that many were unable to fulfill the traditional male role of breadwinner. Thus, despite structural economic and racial inequalities, members of the NOI found pride both in being black and in being a black man through membership in the NOI. Fards successor, Elijah Muhammad, also preached the importance of black men to the history of the earth and added and emphasized new doctrines about a coming racial apocalypse, wherein black men would once more rule on earth. However, Muhammad changed his primary focus from unemployed industrial workers to the growing numbers of imprisoned black men after World War II. Just as Fard had taught black men oppressed by racism and poverty in the 1930s, Muhammad gained new followers among men left behind in Americas postwar boom because of structural race issues—particularly incarcerated men. Through analyzing tracts, newspaper articles, oral histories, and government documents, this paper reveals how the Nation of Islam gave black men new ways of claiming a religious form of masculinity in response to economic and racial inequality.</p>","Their Religion Can Be Defined As Black Man: The Nation Of Islams Message Of Black Masculinity, 1931–1958"

Abolition And Radical Isms Of The Nineteenth Century</h5></p><p>This paper explores the origins of antiabolitionist thought among northern labor reformers in the antebellum United States and locates them in a strain of argument largely developed by British radicals between the Age of Revolution and the Chartist period. First articulated by slaveholders in the British Caribbean in the 1780s, comparisons between slaves and working-class Britons became ubiquitous during the advent of industrialization. As British abolitionists sought to distance themselves from radical causes following the Napoleonic Wars and the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, working-class perceptions of the conservatism of wealthy abolitionists such as William Wilberforce dovetailed with abolitionists tactic of emphasizing the condition of West Indian slaves— an approach that inevitably begged comparisons to impoverished British factory workers. British radicals such as William Cobbett, Richard Carlile, and John Cartwright capitalized on these perceptions by linking such white slavery comparisons to conceptions of racial nationalism and an emerging pseudoscience of race. By the time of West Indian emancipation and the passage of the Factory Act in 1833, white slavery rhetoric was well-established within British radical discourse, and in subsequent decades it was transported across the Atlantic by the spread of print culture and by political expatriates such as the Chartist émigrés John Campbell and Thomas Devyr. While the anti-abolitionist strain of labor ideology was never dominant in either Britain or America, it served to stymie cooperation between labor reformers and abolitionists and provided part of the foundation for long-standing barriers to solidarity among white and black workers.</p>","Those Who Are Greater Slaves Than Themselves: The Transatlantic Origins Of Anti-Abolitionism In Radical Labor Movement Ideology"

At one point, Oberholtzer briefly escaped, found a drug store, and purchased and consumed bichloride of mercury tablets. Upon finding that she had tried to poison herself, Stephenson took her back to Indianapolis and left her on her parents doorstep. Here, Oberholtzers story takes a turn: her parents summoned an attorney, who took Oberholtzers deathbed deposition (she survived for weeks after incident). In shocking, agonizingly thorough, and crystal-clear language, Oberholtzer described everything Stephenson had done to her. Her testimony was used to try and convict Stephenson of mayhem, rape, kidnapping, and conspiracy. Stephenson was sentenced to life in prison, and the Klan went down with him. Locals quoted in the press, however, assumed that Oberholtzer was a party girl who went willingly to Stephensons house. Some alleged that she had seduced Stephenson and manufactured the story to ruin his reputation and bring down the Klan.

Servicemembers and their families began to expect—and demand— that military life become more family friendly. But, as the percentage of married servicemembers grew from 40 to 60 percent, everyday family concerns—sick kids, financial problems, domestic disputes and spousal abuse, child care— began to interfere with everyday military life—training, deployments, maneuvers—with more frequency. This story illustrates the significant overlap between military institutions, civilian and military lobbying organizations, and civil rights groups, illuminating the many ways that domestic politics and changing national values shaped how the military managed sexuality and gender. As younger Americans, who grew up in the civil rights era and witnessed a growing national womens movement, started entering the military, policy makers increasingly confronted activist women (both civilian wives and women in uniform) who were willing to organize, petition, and advocate for the growing needs of their families in an era of economic uncertainty. National womens groups and their allies in Congress also saw the military as a site for pursuing the aspirational goals of feminism to secure womens equality and full citizenship. These groups fought to dismantle barriers to womens full participation in the military and advocated for services such as child care and career services to balance the competing demands of work and family.</p>","We Recruit Individuals But Retain Families: Managing Marriage And Family In The All-Volunteer Force"

That is, black Americans rebelled, and this caused the major decline of the city, which includes extreme poverty, depopulation, abandoned housing, and a crime-ridden, lawless city. Moving into the 2010s, this lack of lawlessness led Detroit to go bankrupt, the largest U.S. municipality ever to so. Now, the city needs reform. Private citizens such as Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert can come in and save Detroit (from its black population?) with investment in downtown, with the Detroit 2.0 rhetoric. This rhetoric is similar to the 19th-century rhetoric of the United States, where settlers talked as if they no indigenous peoples existed, and they could come in and settle on indigenous land. Missing from the larger narrative of postrebellion Detroit, of course, are the experiences of the first nations of Detroit. The erasure of indigenous people from Detroits past and present is an example of what the late settler colonial studies scholar Patrick Wolfe called the logic of elimination. A long-forgotten aspect of postrebellion Detroit is the history of radicalism among Detroits indigenous people.

Characterizing Breckinridge as a champion of the championless, the article lauded what it termed her many-sided work, noting that Miss Breckinridges activities are manifold. Indeed, Breckinridges entry into the national woman suffrage movement coincided with her residence in Hull House and her participation in a range of Progressive reforms. Her keen interest in the problems of working women, poor mothers, and female immigrants informed not only her work for woman suffrage but also her continuing campaigns for social justice in the 1920s and 1930s. At the same time that she campaigned against the equal rights amendment in a bitter battle that, according to some scholarly accounts, pitted advocates of equality against acknowledgments of difference, Breckinridge championed what she termed an effective equality of opportunity and protection, fighting to preserve so-called protective legislation for working women, protect mothers pensions and subsidized health care for poor mothers, and pave the way to citizenship for immigrant women. Although Breckinridge, who never married and instead engaged in a life partnership with fellow social work educator Edith Abbott, worked primarily in single-sex organizations, she also utilized her relationships with male social workers, trade unionists, and politicians to translate her vision of true equality for women into public policy during the New Deal.</p>","Effective Equality: Sophonisba Breckinridges Campaign For Social Justice In Modern America"

Lewis (Grinnell College); Dr. Nic John Fajardo Ramos (Drexel University)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2020-04-02</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 11:00 to 12:30</h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Presentation</h5></p><p>The decades after WWII in the United States are marked by seismic shifts in cultural, scientific, and medical understandings of sex, gender, and sexuality. Clinical professionals coined terms like normal homosexual, established identity categories such as the transsexual, and wrote differential diagnoses based on emerging ideas about the relationship between race, gender, sex, and personhood. The parsing apart of identity categories and types was also centrally important to political affinities and movements for change such as the homophile, gay liberation, feminist, and black power movements of the 1960s. Thus, in addition to seismic shifts in scientific and medical understandings of sex, gender, and sexuality, the mid-to-late-twentieth century is also widely regarded as a critical moment in minority identity formation.In turn, these processes culminated in the removal of homosexuality from the Diagnostical and Statistical Manuel of Mental Disorders in 1973. Understood as a watershed moment in gay and lesbian history, this panel interrogates the (de)pathologization process and the political alliances and strategies that surround this moment in history. The panelists explore questions of normalcy, madness, and deviance as they relate to gay political organizing, insane liberation, and transsexual therapeutics. In From Perverts to Politicians: Community Mental Health, Anti-Poverty Funding, and Homosexual Respectability in Los Angeles, 1965-1986 Nic John Ramos takes up Evelyn Hookers concept of the normal homosexual—a category centrally important to depathologization—in order to access how the normal homosexual was taken up by gay rights activists, culminating in a moderate political force in gay rights organizing. This moderate political force inspired new formations of urban planning and design. Abram J. Lewiss paper The Lunar Effect: Self-Loss and Cosmic Consciousness in the Mad-Queer 1970s examines the convergences and divergences between the gay liberation movement and the insane liberation movement. While many depathologization activists were invested in disidentifying from madness, Lewiss paper returns to the affinities between madness and sexual deviance to imagine this moment otherwise. In Emmett Harsin Dragers paper A Very Strange Case of Female Transsexualism: The University-Based Gender Clinics and the Crafting of a Diagnosis, 1957-1980 they follow the case history of one court-mandated psychiatric patient, who was seen for over a decade at a university gender clinic. The research from these clinics would culminate in the addition of a new category to the DSM in 1980: gender identity disorder. This paper explores how the depatholigization of homosexuality would set the stage for the pathologization of the transsexual.Ultimately, this panel demonstrates that the (de)pathologization campaigns of the 1960s and 1970s were not unilaterally heralded as a victory within the homosexual community. Tracing the fractures of the movement illuminates the multiple histories, meanings, and impacts of the campaign to depathologize homosexuality.</p>","(De)Pathologizing Homosexuality: The Political Fractures Of Psychiatry, Anti-Psychiatry, And Homosexual Movements"

While scholars such as Kelly Lytle Hernández and Edward Escobar have demonstrated the problems of policing and police brutality in Los Angeles, more work is required to illuminate the ways in which activists in local communities resisted the forces of inequality and institutional racism and how these communities organized across racial, class, and gender lines to challenge racist policing.This panel demonstrates how people of color organized to challenge racially biased policing and brutality. It offers a cause study of three different states, Wisconsin, New Mexico and Texas, to situate the agency of Mexican Americans, African Americans, and whites in several diverse communities. First, Brian Behnken shows how the killings of two members of the Black Berets (the New Mexico offshoot of the Brown Berets) and the subsequent protests of Chicano/a activist groups thereafter forced law enforcement to reconsider its racially biased policing measures. Though largely an effort to save face, law enforcement including Albuquerques Chief of Police initiated a series of reforms because of the outspoken protests of the Latinx population. Katherine Bynum explores the vibrancy of coalition-building activist groups in which the Black Panther Party, the Brown Berets, and the Bois dArc patriots, a white working-class organization, built a triumvirate alliance in the aftermath of three police-related shootings in the early 1970s. Her paper demonstrates the power of coalition-building and their determination to end the forces of institutional racism and class antagonism in local and municipal politics. Finally, Sergio González examines how a rising Brown Power movement led by Chicano/a and Puerto Rican activists collaborated, albeit tentatively, with Milwaukees predominantly white-led religious organizations to confront law enforcements disproportionate harassment and surveillance of the citys Latinx population. González illuminates the ways in which religion constituted a vital aspect of broader mobilizations in the national Latino civil rights movement. The three studies broaden our historical understandings of inequitable and racially biased policing and how activists across the nation turned to coalition-building, religion, and civic reform initiatives to demand police accountability. The studies will also illuminate the effects of police repression and how it impacted Brown Power era movement activists and forced them to strategize within existing structures, to form new and potent interracial relationships, and to initiate widespread methods of grassroots organizing to challenge the effects of institutional racism. </p>","<B>A Unified Front Against Police Brutality: How Chicano/As And Their Allies Challenged Police Repression And Violence</B>"

The AHAs Tuning the History Discipline (2011) aimed at the undergraduate history major, followed by Career Diversity for Historians (funded by the Mellon Foundation beginning in 2014) designed to prepare doctoral students for a range of professional opportunities beyond the professoriate, have both sought to address the challenge of communicating, in clear and convincing terms, to students, parents, university administrators, and the public, the immense value and applicability of historical thinking. A range of institutions both in size, 2- and 4-year, and public and private have established effective strategies to mitigate the decline of history degrees and have increased campus resources emphasizing the value and applicability of historical thinking. However, the natural collaboration between the two projects has been less frequently pursued by departments.

Carlos K. Blantons 2016 A Promising Problem: The New Chicana/o History outlines the dominant themes that characterize the fields current scholarship, arguing for an acknowledgement of a proliferation of identities, the decentering of place, reflections on the meaning of the field, and a social justice connection between past and present.  Traditional Chicano studies scholarship relied on a universal, male, proletarian hero—based solely within United States borders—who never interacted with other activists outside of his own racial community.  While recent scholarship breaks away from this paradigm, so too does Chicana/o educational history, where these same innovations are flourishing.  Scholars on this panel draw from innovative methodologies to confront questions about educational equality and inequality in the United States, pushing their analysis beyond traditional narratives of male-centered activism, school segregation, and us-versus-them discussions of resistance and oppression.  Laura Muñozs paper reconstructs a cohort of Mexican American women teachers in the pre-WWII era.  Recovering these womens identities, as well as their professional trajectories, reveals the ways in which educational institutions provided Mexican American women not only with a path to socioeconomic upward mobility, but also a space where they could accommodate and resist the cultural and linguistic oppression dominant in U.S. society of that era.  Philis Barragán Goetzs paper contends that escuelitas—ethnic Mexican community schools—greatly influenced the Mexican American civil rights campaign for educational equality.  Uncovering the escuelita influence behind the Mexican American Generations push for school integration creates a new framework for interpreting the diverse, intersectional, and oppositional identities of these early civil rights activists, as well as highlighting how educational history is a central part of Mexican American history.  David G. Garcías paper unpacks the interdisciplinary methodology of his pioneering work, Strategies of Segregation.  Garcías innovative approach enabled him to establish a connection between residential and school segregation as two processes that developed simultaneously in Oxnard, CA.  Examining the ways in which these two forms of discrimination fed off each other throughout the twentieth century exposes how ethnic minorities worked together across racial lines to overcome them in the civil rights era.  Victoria-María MacDonalds paper destabilizes the notion that Chicana/o education history is a field solely rooted in social history.  Embarking on a historiographic turn in her study of the Chicano Movement, she examines the origins of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and its subsequent relationship with Chicano activists, elucidating the interaction between the state, grassroots activism, and Mexican American academic opportunity.  As a whole, these four papers manifest the new methods and interpretations in Chicana/o educational history that epitomize the innovative and dynamic nature of Chicano studies.  Additionally, they help lay a foundation for understanding the contemporary political debates surrounding the relevance of ethnic studies across the nation.  For Chicana/o educational history, much of the rhetoric regarding equality and inequality of the past is very much the same today.</p>","A Promising Problem Indeed: New Methods And Interpretations In  Chicana/O Educational History"

That dynamic formation drew definition from many sources. The internal structures and practices of the army and navy, state militia units, and veterans organizations like the Grand Army of the Republic or the United Confederate Veterans were constitutive, as were the complex relationships between such entities and the broader American society. This session will examine three case studies in the connections between Civil War experience and postwar developments in military culture. Each paper distills an established scholar&quot;s research for a book in progress. Jennifer M. Murray, a leading specialist in Civil War military culture and its legacies, will comment on the papers, and Lorien Foote, another distinguished authority in the field, will chair a discussion.The papers focus on three different parts of the country and three different approaches to the reverberations of the Civil War. Barbara A. Gannon&quot;s contribution spotlights the South and the cultural formation known as the Lost Cause. She examines white southern celebration of Confederate martial achievement as a vindication of the underlying society. Professor Gannon challenges that narrative by analyzing the ways in which organized enforcement of slavery contributed to Confederate battlefield success. Her comparison of antebellum preparation, wartime outcomes, and postwar ideology measures the manipulation of history. John R. Neff&quot;s paper concentrates on the Midwestern metropolis of Chicago in the iconic 1871 fire. He interweaves enduring bonds and rivalries of veteran Civil War commanders from the regular army and the U. S. Volunteeers with the tensions between federal and state authority during the implementation of Reconstruction legislation designed to protect African American voters. His research reveals the weight of Civil War memory in a moment of postwar crisis. Thomas Brown&quot;s study of Zouaves notes their national popularity but concentrates on their opponents in the policymaking centers of the Northeast. He shows how the conjunction of theatrical and military performance that excited Zouave volunteers during the Civil War made the identity vulnerable to attack in the late nineteenth century. His treatment recovers the lost appeal of the Zouave and illuminates a profound change in conceptions of soldiering.The session will address American military culture from the antebellum period into the early twentieth century while also highlighting the importance of fine-grained inquiry into such features of the Civil War as the Confederate cavalry, the Union high command, and the recruitment of infantry for both armies. The panelists hope the discussion will interest Civil War military historians and also cultural historians, Reconstruction historians, southern historians, urban historians, and gender historians. </p>","American Military Culture In The Civil War And Beyond"

Some raised mulberry trees and silkworms. Others read and wrote about best practices. Silk connected all of them--in great and small ways--to transnational commercial networks and swirling debates about expansion and economic development. This panel offers three histories of American silk to explore the overlapping racial, political, and economic justifications for sericulture experiments, the global context of local production, and the diverse meanings attributed to the prized commodity. Panelists will discuss how politicians, religious leaders, slave owners, and bureaucrats  in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries embraced silk production as a salve for many political, social, and economic ills. In newspaper articles, treatises, and pamphlets, supporters proclaimed the advantages of an industry that beautified and settled the landscape, converted savage peoples, required little capital outlay, attracted immigrants to the Americas, and occupied the idle time of dependents, namely white women, enslaved people, and children as well as the impoverished, infirm, and elderly. This discourse provides insight into shifting visions of and debates about settler colonialism, industrial capitalism, and international trade.Silk boosterism inflated expectations and obscured challenges. Panelists will also explore the hard realities of silk production. Laborers often did not have the necessary skills, expertise, free time, or technology to create a good product. Despite the risk and failure that dogged the industry, people kept trying to make silk work. Unwavering commitment to colonial projects, religious ideals, and entrepreneurial ventures kept them motivated, as did the different values that they applied to local or domestic production. The commodity connected families, households, plantations, and communities in America to the international marketplace and transnational labor flows. The layers of meaning that people attributed to silk emerged from this global context and on-the-ground experiences with sericulture.These three papers, arranged in chronological order, emphasize a handful of themes, namely settler colonialism, entrepreneurship, gendered work, migration, and global commerce. Danielle Skeehans paper explores how Englands sustained sponsorship of colonial sericulture also gave rise to the emergent discourses of colonial difference and began the work of imagining an Atlantic division of labor and resources. Ben Marsh explores the foreign species that silk helped to transplant to the Americas--including species of trees and migrant experts from Mediterranean Europe who did not always make smooth transitions into American populations--assessing to what extent silk production in the Atlantic world connected to older or emerging markets. Sasha Coles will discuss the labors of women silk producers in the nineteenth-century Great Basin and their transnational business networks to shed light on the gendered contours of the Mormon Churchs economic program, the role of fashion and desire in debates over polygamy, and the complex, at times conflicting meanings that Mormon women assigned to silk clothing. </p>","American Silk, Transnational Commerce, And Geographies Of Identity"

While the American Historical Associations Guidelines for Professional Evaluation of Digital Scholarship by Historians provide a useful framework for articulating the value and place of digital scholarship within the discipline of history, these conversations have largely taken place within the context of Tenure and Promotion. Similarly, the Journal of American Historys Digital History Reviews articulate how to evaluate digital scholarly work, but the projects reviewed are often created by teams of scholars beyond the dissertation stage. The conditions under which digital work is created at the doctoral level do not align with conditions in the larger field of digital history: doctoral students generally have fewer available resources and funding opportunities, the collaborative nature of much digital history work is at odds with the sole-authored dissertation, and paths to publication are nascent.These dissertations provide three examples of argument-driven digital scholarship, where critical engagement with medium and methods is central. The session will include demonstrations of the projects followed by a robust discussion about the process, evaluation, and implication of digital dissertations for the discipline. The panel will feature three early career scholars and members of their committees: Celeste Tường Vy Sharpe and Suzanne Smith, Jeri E. Wieringa and Sharon Leon, and Zoe LeBlanc and Madeleine Casad. These projects highlight the range of digital work in history and emphasize the contributions of women to this subfield.Sharpes dissertation project, They Need You! Disability, Visual Culture, and the Poster Child, 1945-1980, argues that poster child imagery is vital for understanding the cultural pervasiveness of the idea of disability-as-diagnosis and how that understanding underpinned political avenues and policies of disease eradication in twentieth century America. This project is presented through the digital publishing platform Scalar in a re-presentation of the elements required of a historical dissertation that foregrounds the visual materials.Wieringas dissertation project, A Gospel of Health and Salvation: Modeling the Religious Culture of Seventh-day Adventism, 1843-1920, is an applied methodological study, examining the application of text mining to historical research through a study of end-times beliefs and gender in Seventh-day Adventism in nineteenth-century America. She argues for the centrality of beliefs about time in the development of the denominations culture, as seen particularly in constructions of gender, as well as for the importance of documented and reproducible methods as part of the scholarly output of computational analysis in history.LeBlancs dissertation project, Cairo Calling: The United Arab Republic, Revolutionary Media, and Global Anti-Colonialism in the 1950s and 60s, examines the emergence of Egypt, later known as the United Arab Republic, as an international hub for anti-colonial media and revolutionary politics. This project leverages a combination of text and image sources with computational methods to trace the shifting discourses and symbolism of anti-colonialism in Cairo, and explores ways to bridge numbers and narratives at various scales of historical analysis.</p>","Argument, Form, And Method: Lessons Learned From Three Digital Dissertations In History"

Genevieve Clutario will demonstrate how the public spectacle of beauty pageants during the U.S. colonial era emerged as a critical site for Filipino national identity formation, as women and men contested their inclusion and exclusion from the State practices of U.S. empire. Focusing on the early twentieth century when the Philippines was a formal part of the United States yet relegated to colonial status, Clutarios presentation will explore how women challenged gendered, classed, and raced frameworks structured not only by their positionality as women within Philippine society, but also as mediated by the hierarchies of empire. Then, Dorothy Fujita-Rony will examine the lives of two Indonesian women, H.L. Tobing and Minar T. Rony, as they negotiated the gendered and racialized inequalities of  an inter-empire context shaped by Dutch, German, Japanese, and U.S. imperialism. Fujita-Ronys presentation will pay special attention to how these womens lives were shaped by U.S. empire in their role as knowledge workers in a trans-Pacific context during the U.S. Cold War. Finally, Judy Tzu-Chun Wus presentation will move the discussion to a close examination of the life and career of U.S. congressional representative Patsy Mink. Born and raised in Hawaii, Mink became the first woman of color to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. A tireless advocate of race, class, gender, and educational equality, Mink not only was a key legislator during the Great Society period during Johnsons administration, but also continued to defend and expand welfare legislation when she returned to Congress in the 1990s. The papers collectively feature women of Asian ancestry, located on the margins of the U.S. imperial nation-state, who nevertheless found innovative ways of navigating political power. The panel foregrounds underexplored historical subjects - colonial nationals, native informants, and U.S. citizens from the Asia Pacific - who negotiated the terms of belonging in such unexpected political forums as beauty pageants, the military-educational complex, and congressional representation.</p>","Asian/American Women, The State, And Belonging"

In their struggle for freedom, African Americans have generated ideas about death or the deceased; engaged in rituals and customs that enabled the mourning of black victims of racial violence; leveraged spaces conventionally reserved for the deceased, such as funeral homes and cemeteries, to contest discrimination or build community; and engaged in the construction of public memory to define the legacy of black activists. Investigating the intersection of black resistance and death over a long temporal scope, we question how discourses about dying and the deceased have influenced the black fight for racial and gender equality. Organized chronologically, the first paper explores the use of burial grounds by enslaved blacks on nineteenth century plantations. Drawing on oral histories, testimony, and antebellum era narratives, the paper interrogates the grave as a site crucial to the autonomy of enslaved blacks in creating community and engaging in everyday forms of resistance. The second presentation centers black club womens use of eulogies to shore up their campaign for racial uplift during the rise of Jim Crow.  With a stake in the moral future of the nation, club women promoted social regeneration in their tributes to the deceased and this paper explores the ideas about death, the after-life, and the other-world that emanated from their reflections and informed their organizing efforts. Focused on the Anti-Lynching Crusaders, a small cadre of black women led by Mary Talbert in the early twentieth century, the third paper examines how the organization ritualized mourning through prayer and collective action to center deceased victims of lynching and rally activists around the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill. The paper builds on scholarship interested in the phenomenology of prayer to illuminate how the Crusaders strategically deployed the practice to summon attention to the black deceased and engage black communities in public policy reform.  The fourth and final presentation investigates Milwaukees post-World War II grassroots movement for police accountability.  It analyzes how the movement leveraged the tragedy of black death at the hands of the police in ways that concurrently humanized black victims while also advancing the ongoing struggle for more just policing structures.</p>","Beyond The Grave: Black Resistance And The Deceased"

Using history to illuminate the problem of racial stereotyping in the media, the program will also include student activities which illicit creative responses addressing racial stereotyping. BOAM tells the story of Boston-based African American newspaper editor and activist William M. Trotter who waged a battle against D.W. Griffiths technically groundbreaking but notoriously Ku Klux Klan-friendly film The Birth of a Nation, unleashing a fight that still rages today about race relations, media representation, and the power and influence of Hollywood. Birth of a Movement, based on Dick Lehr&quot;s book The Birth of a Movement: How Birth of a Nation Ignited the Battle for Civil Rights, captures the backdrop to this prescient clash between human rights, freedom of speech, and a changing media landscape.  The film features a number of prominent scholars, Henry Louis Gates Jr, Vincent Brown, Robert Bellinger, Dick Lehr, Dolita Cathcart, Charlie Mussser, David Blight, Spike Lee, Reginald Hudlin, many of them based in Boston.In the public screenings that have taken place to date, it is clear that the rich content of the film can be levered to spark discussions in a way that is comprehensive, respectful, insightful and effective.  It opens up a discussion about propaganda, how it has been used throughout history to support bias, and negative racial stereotypes, and offers constructive ways to counter that propaganda.  Northern Light Productions, in partnership with the Boston Public Schools, the NAACP, Universities, parents groups and citizens group, are joining forces to use BOAM, to open an important debate about how the memory of our history was distorted, and reexamine how that distortion has led to the racial crisis we find ourselves in today.Studies show that by teaching students how propaganda has been used to negatively stereotype immigrants and people of color, they can overcome self-imposed stereotypes and achieve beyond their own expectations. In response to a need expressed by Colin Rose, Assistant Superintendent of the Boston Public Schools, we have partnered with Dr. Rose, the NAACP, and outstanding members of the Boston academic community who appear in our film, to promote discussions and a curriculum based on the film, that include a geographic learning component putting NLPs museum and virtual exhibit experience to use on this project.  We would like to show the film at the OAH annual conference, and publicize the availability of the BOAM culturally relevant curriculum.</p>","Birth Of A Movement: Do You Know William Monroe Trotter?"

Knowlton (Princeton University Library); Dr. Darius Jamal Young (Florida A&M University)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2020-04-02</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 11:00 to 12:30</h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Presentation</h5></p><p>Memphis, Tennessee, provides an excellent case study of the long civil rights movement with its rich history of freedom fighters over time in the face of varied white resistance.  Unlike most areas in the South during the Jim Crow era of segregation and discrimination, African Americans in Memphis could vote because of the combination of a white machine government that sought their ballots, a state government that had less restrictive voting measures compared to others in the South, and skilled black leadership and grassroots activists that took advantage of these circumstances and used the ballot as a tool for racial advancement.  This session looks at three key moments of the long black freedom struggle in Memphis in which racial inequalities were challenged through black political power and that involved institutions.  The first paper examines how Robert R. Church, Jr., the key black political leader in the city, and black Memphians, responded to the horrific 1917 lynching of black woodchopper Ell Persons.  They created organizations and institutions such as the local NAACP branch that would have an impact on the city for decades.  At the time, Church headed the Lincoln League, a local black political organization that he used as a platform for denouncing lynching and otherwise speaking out for racial justice.  Church would go on to be the most prominent black Republican in the nation in the 1920s and 1930s and continued to advocate for civil rights through the 1940s.  The second paper deals with Mayor Edmund Orgills controversial suggestion in 1956 to appoint an African American, Dr. J. E. Walker, to the Board of Trustees of the charitable John Gaston Hospital.  He asked the public to express their opinion on the matter.  At the time, Memphis had no black elected or appointed officials.  African Americans were overwhelmingly in favor of Orgills idea, whereas whites were divided.  Bowing to white opposition and harassment, Orgill ultimately decided to not appoint Walker, who was a medical doctor.  One argument provided by those in favor of the proposal was that black representation on the board was necessary because 85 percent of the patients of the hospital were African American.  This paper reveals how blacks and whites advocated for this courageous, civil rights stance of Mayor Orgill that was the way of the future.By the mid-1960s, African Americans were being appointed to public office and winning elected office in Memphis.  Some of the civil rights activists who had powered the citys mass-based desegregation movement earlier in the decade were becoming elected officials themselves.  The third paper examines how these civil rights veterans-turned-elected officials forged a governing coalition in the late 1970s and early 1980s to reform and expand the city hospital into the Regional Medical Center, a leading public medical institution devoted to equitable health care.  The paper examines their success at a time in which conservative political forces were on the rise in Memphis and nationally.</p>","Black Political Power Against Inequality In Memphis, Tennessee"

A common understanding of the 1960s New Left frames it as primarily a white student movement, perhaps initially inspired by the Black Student Movement in the South to a more singular focus on stopping the war in Vietnam.  Historians have tended to emphasized discontinuity between iterations of the Left in the U.S., which has made it especially hard to recognize the significant contributions of 1940s-era black radicals in keeping multi-faceted analysis connecting labor, race, class, and gender exploitation in circulation as part of the eras  creative expressions of culture and politics. Yet the concepts of intersectionality, triple oppression, black internationalism, and, indeed, especially in the case of the British New Left, any nuanced vision of race and racism substantially grew out of the black New Left in the 1950s and 1960s. The papers in this panel emphasize the influence of black leftists and radical organizations on the shape of the New Left in the 1960s and 1970s, a time in which notions of liberation and self-determination came to take precedence over equality as key terms of the Left in the United States and the United Kingdom.Jim Smethursts paper looks at the British political and cultural work alliances set in motion by black Communist Claudia Jones, deported from the US in 1955, in founding the newspaper, the West Indian Gazette and Afro-Asian Caribbean News in London in 1958. Its fundamental argument is that Jones brought a U.S. black Left approach institution building with profound effects on British radicalism. Judith Smiths paper explores the contributions of a group of radical Blacks artists (Ruby Dee, Ossie Davis, Harry Belafonte, Lorraine Hansberry, John  O. Killens and Alice Childress) who built on their  their work in organizations allied with the Communist Left in the late 1940s to develop new stances of black nationalism, liberation, and self-determination. Rachel Rubins paper analyzes the radical cartoons published by African American cartoonist Brumsic Brandon, Jr., most famous for his long-running strip Luther,  to depict what Rubin labels a declarative rejection of systemic racism in Freedomways, a journal that was founded by veterans of the Black Popular Front working with younger African American radicals energized by the rise of SNCC and the Black Student Movement in the early 1960s. Rubins paper conclude by taking up the larger questions of the influence of radical black cartooning on the U.S. Left in the 1960s and 1970s.Gerald Horne of the University of Houston will comment on the papers.</p>","Black Radicalism And The New Left, 1955–1970"

Facing an uncertain political landscape, in which traditional appeals and historical alliances no longer sufficed, politicians in the 1840s and 1850s turned toward populism, red-baiting, and racial nationalism to generate broader support for their policies. These papers focus on an era of political flux, when party loyalty seemed to be determined by geographical location and each party seemed so mired in its own political liquidity that it no longer looked past immediate expediency; when the questions at issue spoke so fundamentally to the nature and character of the national body and the stability and duration of its democratic institutions; when each of the seismic issues confronting the country carried an inflexible and insoluble moral weight on both sides; and when two discrete systems of language developed—with completely separate mediated experiences and completely divergent worldviews—so that communication became impossible. If you wish to mark the first indications of a revolution, the commencement of those profound changes in the character of a people which are working beneath, before a ripple appears on the surface, John C. Calhoun once advised, look to the change of language. These profound changes first materialized in the altered meaning of important words, in language that ignited and accelerated the transformation of the peoples feelings and principles, until the words themselves induced an entire revolution.In Andrew Zimmermans Black Republicans, Red Republicans, and the Coming of the Civil War, the colored language associated with the Republican Party implicated it in all manner of foreign and domestic radicalism (in the words of one political cartoon, Popery, Fourierism, Free Love, Woman&quot;s Rights, the Maine Law, &amp; above all the Equality of our Colored brethren) to which it was, to some extent, legitimately connected. In both Matthew Karps An Antebellum One Percent: The Slave Power and Republican Party Populism in the 1850s and Danielle Holtzs The Color of Loyalty: Conservatism and Racial Nationalism in Antebellum Politics, the Republican and Democratic parties each exploit the class and racial tensions that drove socio-cultural allegiances in the hopes that these dynamics would translate into popular support. In all of these cases, mainstream parties embraced previously marginalized identities and positions to shore up their political power and were definitively changed in the process. Examining the partisan use of ideological language, each partys real or express populism, and their strategic association with radical movements, this panel traces the path by which nominal politics take center stage in the United States.</p>","Black, White, And Red: Antebellum Party Politics On The Ideological Margins"

Donald Trump has challenged core ideas of liberalism such as international alliances, regulations, and progressive taxation that have been central to the Party since at least the 1930s. Even before Trumps victory, pundits have been heralding the rise of a new Democratic majority, an argument grounded largely in what some see as demographic destiny. That claim is somewhat akin to the situation in the 1920s, when immigrant urban voters swelled the ranks of the Democratic Party. With Trumps approval ratings low, there is great hope that 2020 could turn into some sort of turning point for the period that helps to cement a New Democratic Majority.  When FDR won in 1932 by a landslide, Raymond Moley said to Roosevelts two top political strategists, You have done more than just elect a president. You have created a new party for the next 25 years.  But such monumental changes are not inevitable or automatic. Indeed, polls and pundits alike were flat out wrong in 2016 and the emerging Democratic majority has yet to materialize. With that in mind, this roundtable will take a look back at another critical moment in the development of the Democratic Party: the 1932 election. The participants will offer fresh insights into this famous realigning election to better understand exactly what happened and how Democrats were able to secure this victory. As opposed to familiar narratives of inevitability that present a clear path toward Democratic success, the roundtable will discuss what was happening to the party that allowed them to take advantage of the moment. Panelists will also look forward to the multiple elections that returned FDR and the Democrats to power in the 1930s and 1940s, cementing the new coalition. We will talk about the mechanisms, institutions, ideas, voters, and organizations that enabled success. We will examine how FDR built a long-term majority with new attachments, new organization, and new branding.Revisiting this election is a perfect opportunity to better understand how long-term coalitions can take form and emerge out of single elections. Meg Jacobs will offer thoughts on the grassroots organizational effort to capitalize on the rise of the new immigrant voter while bringing in the rural Midwest and West; Kathryn Olmsted will discuss the role of the conservative media and the efforts of Democrats to overcome a largely GOP-dominated media; and David Greenberg will consider how the Democratic Party became a liberal party in part in response to the rise of totalitarianism. </p>","Bringing Partisanship Back In: Party Politics In The Age Of Roosevelt"

And in recent years historians have also charted the health crisis that greeted wartime emancipation. Although the Civil War ended legal enslavement in the United States it failed to eradicate the racial essentialism at its foundation, and African Americans found their physical selves still subjected to white dominance, including in medicine and its allied sciences. Indeed, physicians, scientists, reformers, and intellectuals—many under the auspices of the federal government—developed new and seemingly objective ways for measuring and conceptualizing bodily difference that would provide the requisite racial infrastructure in the modern, post-slavery nation.This panel explores how thinkers, practitioners, and their subjects produced racial knowledge and naturalized it in the plain wrapper of scientific objectivity. Braiding together the political revolution of emancipation and the concurrent revolutions in medical thinking and state-building, it investigates the overlooked intersection of race, health, science, and the nation in late-nineteenth century America. How did the abundance of somatic data gathered during the Civil War underwrite—or undermine—emerging understandings of racial difference? What accounts for the federal governments robust interest in objectifying its citizens and in deploying ostensibly unmediated statistics to the social problem of a multiracial population? And how did African Americans challenge, negotiate, and influence these affronts to their hard-won freedom and citizenship rights in the shadow of an erstwhile regime of objectification?To address these questions, panelists investigate important currents of race-making during the Civil War and its aftermath. Sarah E. Gardner considers the purifying and racializing discourses that worked in tandem over the Civil War era to reforge the white, post-slavery republic. Rana A. Hogarth examines eugenic race crossing studies as applied to mixed race individuals in the Americas, revealing how scientific and medical authorities went about measuring miscegenation and to what ends. Leslie Schwalm likewise explores the measurement and commodification of African Americans—in particular, the ways in which Union military medical practitioners appropriated the racialized bodies of black soldiers for scientific analysis. Dale Kretz investigates how formerly enslaved pensioners negotiated their disability claims against the new, biomedical technologies and techniques deployed by the federal administrative state. Together, the panelists suggest the importance of understanding how the late-nineteenth century fascination with commensurability and scientific objectivity served as the base alloy for the nation-state rid of slavery but not racial hierarchy. At the same time, the panel grapples with how African Americans confronted, endured, and undermined these scientific affronts to their newfound citizenship.</p>","Calculating Inequality: Science, Health, And Citizenship In The Age Of Emancipation"
"<h5><i>Professor Jonathan Levy (University of Chicago); Dr. Sharon Ann Murphy (Providence College); Mr. Daniel Platt (University at Buffalo, State University of New York); Mr. Alastair Yuanhao Su (Stanford University)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2020-04-03</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 08:00 to 09:30</h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Presentation</h5></p><p>The idea of capital, remarked Henry George, was something beset with ambiguities. In his bestselling Progress and Poverty, George noted that although all sorts of things that have a value were vaguely spoken of as capital, the use of the term among economic writers vary so widely that the term can hardly be said to have a fixed meaning. Throughout the nineteenth-century United States, capital was everywhere: it had built up the cotton mills of the northeast, constructed the turnpikes, canals, telegraph and railroads that formed the sinews of an industrializing economy, and upended centuries-old rhythms of social, religious and economic life. But as George observed, while the power of capital was undeniable, its meaning was labile and unfixed, its definition in textbooks unmoored from its manifestation in plantations, cargo holds, courtrooms, and shop floors. This panel argues that capitals ambiguity was no accident of semantics, but a function of power. Taking up historian Jonathan Levys charge to reconsider capital as a matter of power and politics, of determining which assets get capitalized, under what terms, and for the benefit of whom, this paper panel denaturalizes capital by presenting it in three different contexts in nineteenth-century America. In her paper on slavery and foreclosures, Sharon Ann Murphy revisits the legal contests over banks attempts to seize married womens financial assets—including the slaves they owned. These debates, as her paper shows, pitted the gendered norms of widow protection against the logic of racial capitalism as courts determined the extent to which slaves bodies could be capitalized into financial assets. In a different but striking case, Alastair Sus paper captures the process through which millions of dollars worth of Indian opium were converted into international capital through Anglo-American financial institutions during the Jacksonian period. Piecing together the records of the Bank of the United States, Barings and various American and British opium firms, he demonstrates how anxieties over drug prohibition in China spread into global money markets, stoking the Panic of 1839. Finally, Daniel Platt interrogates the relationship between nineteenth-century debt instruments and the construction of financial time. Time in the Gilded Age, he argues, was neither experienced in a simple nor homogenous fashion, but was shaped and distorted by the logic of financial capital.

Eatmon (Northwestern University); Dr. Melissa Lambert Milewski (University of Sussex); Miss Hollie Pich (University of Sydney); Professor Barbara Young Welke (University of Minnesota)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2020-04-03</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 15:00 to 16:30</h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Presentation</h5></p><p>This panel will focus on African American interactions with civil courts during the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. Historians have established that the legal system perpetuated racial inequality in America. The courts shored up slavery and racial segregation; provided a forum for racial identity to be clarified, articulated, and imposed; and enabled the criminalization of black men and women. Scholars have also focused on ways in which the courts played a part in ushering in rights related to race in cases such as Brown v. Board of Education. An emerging field of study, however, looks beyond legal issues that were explicitly about race—and, in doing so, complicates our understanding of race and the legal system in the United States. African Americans experiences in civil cases in southern courts are central to this project. This panel, therefore, seeks to deepen our understanding of the courts by examining the limits and opportunities within civil courts for African American litigants during the era of Jim Crow. In particular, the panel challenges the idea of the courts as spaces that only perpetuate inequality; as an institution that acted on, rather than interacted with, African Americans. It does so by focusing its attention on how African Americans created legal spaces for themselves within a system of oppression. This panel will tackle key questions, such as: how did African Americans familiarize themselves with the legal system? What strategies did they implement in the courtroom? How did they use the courtroom to improve their lives? How did their legal action affect their relationships with other white and black southerners? What was the role of black women in this litigation?   The panel will successively build on these questions. First, Hollie Pichs paper will draw on her archival research in local courts in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss African Americans&quot; legal knowledge, and how they prepared for court, including how they hired lawyers and tracked down witnesses. Second, Myisha Eatmon will use her research in personal injury cases to focus on the legal strategies implemented in the courtroom by black litigants. Finally, Melissa Milewski will examine African American women&quot;s strategies and experiences in civil suits that reached southern state appellate courts during the period of Jim Crow.Rather than focusing on the litigation strategies of national organizations or the work of prominent litigators in federal courts, these papers will illustrate the legal action of African Americans in both local and state courts. By bringing together scholars at the vanguard of the new historiography on African Americans and the courts and examining the civil cases of ordinary people, this panel will help us re-conceptualize the role of the courts in black southerners lives and provide a window into different paths to equality for oppressed groups—not just for African Americans, but also for immigrants, the LGBTQI community, white women, and other women of color.</p>","Challenging Inequality In Americas Civil Courts: African American Litigants In The Era Of Jim Crow"

McKevitt (Louisianna Tech University); Dr. Paul Renfro (Florida State University)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2020-04-02</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 14:30 to 16:00</h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Presentation</h5></p><p>America is violent. From the degradation of black and brown bodies through chattel slavery to the exterminationist logics of westward expansion to the seemingly endless war on terror, violence has proven a central and enduring feature of the American experience. Yet scholars of recent United States history, in the main, have not employed violence as a category of analysis. Building on exciting new work by Kathleen Belew, Christina Hanhardt, and others, this session will illuminate the role of violence—and its cultural representations—in shaping the recent American past.In so doing, our panel will engage some of the key dynamics at play in the Organization of American Historians 2020 conference theme, (In)Equalities. Violence, the threat of violence, and cultures of violence work to produce and perpetuate inequality. As Max Weber famously argued, power lives within the institutions and bodies that can enact violence legitimately—with impunity and in the name of ensuring order. Webers insight informs each of the sessions papers, which explore (in discrete yet imbricated ways) the interplay between violence, power, and politics in the US—and in transnational perspective—since the 1970s.The sessions papers move in rough chronological order from the late 1970s to the immediate post-Cold War period, beginning with Desiree Abu-Odehs work. Abu-Odeh assesses the feminist sex wars and its cultural politics of violence from the vantage of the college campus. She reveals how campus activists in the 1970s and 1980s drew on, and intervened in, feminist debates concerning pornography and sexual violence. Their efforts, Abu-Odeh shows, led to the creation of new policies and practices designed to serve the needs of sexual assault survivors on college campuses. Many of these policies and practices remain firmly entrenched today.Next, Paul Renfro focuses on competing conceptions of race, class, and violence within the 1979–81 Atlanta youth abductions and murders. Various constituencies understood the Atlanta saga on vastly different terms. Renfro explores the rhetorical and policy responses of the poor black communities most acutely affected by the kidnappings and slayings; Atlantas neoliberal, biracial political and economic establishment; and observers (both in the US and internationally) who called the murders a genocide. Such divergent responses, Renfro reveals, reflected and reinforced some of the key fault lines in late twentieth-century US political culture.Finally, Andrew McKevitt examines the 1992 shooting death of Yoshi Hattori, a sixteen-year-old Japanese exchange student, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and the transnational gun-control movement it generated as a way of understanding the global impact of local American violence. Local activists attuned to the connections between gun violence and socioeconomic inequality in Baton Rouge attempted to connect Yoshis death to the easy availability of guns and the consequent impact of gun violence across racial and class boundaries. They stalled in the face of powerful interests, however, invested in a post-1960s rhetoric of law and order and the growing political power of pro-gun organizations like the National Rifle Association. Considered together, these papers take violence as an animating force—and an engine of inequality—in recent American history.</p>","Cold War, Culture Wars, And The Cultural Politics Of Violence"

Cohen (Lafayette College); Dr. Melanie Kiechle (Virginia Tech);  Lawrence Mintz (University of Maryland, College Park); Professor Emily Jane Pawley (Dickinson College)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2020-04-04</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 10:00 to 11:30</h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Presentation</h5></p><p>Nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century periodicals often poked fun at science and technology, through cartoons, satirical writings, pithy anecdotes, and poetry. Many scholars have argued that these jabs were part of Americans anti-elitism and anti-intellectualism, but scientists and engineers also enjoyed a laugh. Indeed, they employed humor and used these same genres to publicize new discoveries and mock overly-serious or inept colleagues. Some of these jokes remained behind closed doors of professional meetings. Other samples of humorous science circulated within professional journals and trade publications, while some made their way into periodicals read by the wider public. And many Americans learned of and reacted to scientific and technological works-in-progress from the parodies and doggerel of the comic press, broadside parables, and performance spaces. Together, such visions of science and technology offered a public, non-specialist view of the nascent professional endeavors of scientific thinkers and presumed innovators.This panel will explore how humor communicated and complicated science in the United States. From geology to industrial machinery, agriculture to communication technology, Americans both had fun with science and technology and learned about them through humor.  AJ Blandford introduces us to the role that humor played in establishing and questioning Americas first public science, geology. As the basis for internal improvements, geologists and their findings were the subject of intense public and political scrutiny, which frequently mocked the science. As public servants, geologists mocked their scientific rival instead of their political foes. By reading through and against the humor, Blandford argues that humorous attacks reveal the conflicting hopes and anxieties different groups had about entrusting the authority of this new class of technical experts.Melanie Kiechle will discuss plumbing poetry and sardonic takes on industrial labor. Through wit, Kiechle argues, both technological experts and observers familiarized Americans with the tremendous changes in built environs, medical knowledge, and industrial production. Environmental historians have argued that these changes created a second nature that alienated individuals from the natural world and ushered in many anxieties of modernity, but Kiechle suggests humor revealed and made approachable what was otherwise obscured. Benjamin Cohen adds to the session with an analysis of the ways cartoonists, humorists, and vaudeville actors reacted to and reshaped the perceptions of new technologies. Examples about electricity, telephones, factory life, and the general demeanor of the inventor reveal a picture of savvy consumers whose angst and concern over new technological systems show how users configure, manipulate, and challenge the notion that novelty equals improvement. Finally, Emily Pawley will address the challenge of negotiating contemporary audiences sense of humor. While many nineteenth-century jokes fall flat in the classroom, serious and regular topics of nineteenth-century agricultural concern elicit snorts and giggles today. Is it possible, Pawley asks, to use anachronistic humor to explore the corporeal realities of daily life? Overall, our exploration of scientific humor past and present binds together studies in humor and comedy, the history of science and technology, environmental history, and cultural histories of the long nineteenth century.</p>","Comedy, Cartoons, And Satire: Communicating Science And Technology"

We bring together five historians who work on the histories of racialized communities and have taken distinct pathways towards making this work more widely accessible. Some panelists personally identify with the communities they write about while others do not. Using their experiences as a starting point, panelists will discuss the benefits and challenges of integrating public history into our work as academics, and specifically, as scholars seeking to make research about communities of color available to those communities as well as the wider public. Meant to highlight different facets of conducting public-facing work—getting started, finding partners, crafting the purpose, devising the scope of project, reaching out to new audiences, and assessing/evaluating our work for tenure and promotion—the goal is to provide participants with a variety of creative possibilities for making the transition from traditional modes of historical work to public history in a way that is attentive to issues of power and representation.The conversation will include topics such as, How does one get started in public history? What are the challenges we might face in the process? How can scholars navigate the challenges of identifying, or not identifying, with the people they study and whom they want to reach through public initiatives? How can community partnerships be created and tended with care? How can historians integrate this work into their career trajectories both before and after tenure?Panelists are historians who have generated historically-informed op/eds and media, theater productions, podcasts, museum exhibitions, community-based oral history and archives, and collaborations with K-12 educators. Two panelists have academic appointment in public history, while three have embarked on public-facing work from more traditional training and appointments. They work in the fields of African American, Latinx, and Native American history. They have all received external funding, ranging from modest to significant, for their public history projects, and are eager to share the strategies theyve tried and mistakes theyve made in conversation with the audience.</p>","Communities Of Color And Public History: Challenges, Strategies, And Questions For Budding And Seasoned Public Historians"

Cajka (University of Notre Dame);  Charles McCrary (Washington University in St. Louis); Dr. Ronit Stahl (University of California, Berkeley); Professor Megan Threlkeld (Denison University)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2020-04-02</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 12:45 to 14:15</h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Presentation</h5></p><p>This panel explores the history of a present dilemma. Corporations like Hobby Lobby assert conscience rights, as if they were individuals. Republican politicians routinely issue legislation or executive orders protecting hospital personnel from participation in abortion procedures. Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz celebrated Kentucky clerk Kim Daviss conscientious refusal to issue a gay couple a marriage license. Sincerely held conscience convictions have become an influential – and troublesome – political category in the contemporary United States. How did the word conscience become such a hot button issue? The process by which this category became foundational to our time is not natural, these papers argue, but historical and political. The ascent of sincerely held beliefs into the political mainstream has been a complex and uneven process. The aim of this panel is to provide clarity about their origins and consequences. Conscience claims – an assertion that following a law goes against an internally held truth – originated in contests over conscription and only later migrated to the arena of reproductive politics. Crucial to understanding the rise of conscience claims is the interplay between war and sexuality in the twentieth century United States. Charles McCrary locates the genesis of sincerity as a legal category in the transformation of the draft laws during and just after the Second World War. The process by which the state shifted from exemption for strict pacifists out of peace churches to sincerely held belief, secular or religious, raised the initial dilemmas about how the state should handle conscience claims. He shows how a variety of actors from churches, government agencies, and the courts constituted the category. Peter Cajka demonstrates how simultaneous debates over contraception and conscription in the Catholic Church facilitated the rise of conscience rights at the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s. Then his paper follows how debates over military service during the Vietnam War laid the groundwork for rise of conscience clauses in the realm of abortion. Ronit Stahl examines the dynamics by which Catholic hospitals were both secular spaces that provided government services and religious institutions that received exemptions from government regulations. Her paper shows how conscience politics roiled Congress, the court system, and the US Catholic Bishops in the mid-1970s. Her research shows just how thinly drawn are the lines between secular and religious conscience claims. This panel demonstrates that war and reproductive rights are profoundly intertwined in American History. These presentations also touch on many of the themes that define the deep contradictions of American life after the Second World War: the individual and the group; internal moral conviction and the law; the secular and the sacred; and assertions of individual freedom alongside massive state programs of coercion. This panel raises two key questions: just how free should the deeply convicted individual American be from military service and programs of reproductive health? How does the political and legal system create exemptions for conscience-followers? These papers will help us to begin writing a history of the convoluted present.</p>","Conscience Politics In The Twentieth-Century United States"

Reagan (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2020-04-02</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 11:00 to 12:30</h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Presentation</h5></p><p>Perceived capacity has determined ones access to citizenship rights, social benefits, and legal protections throughout U.S. history. This panel of four scholarly papers examines different groups of people making claims for benefits and rights by claiming of deservedness and (in)capacity. For some populations, capacity substantiated their deservedness; for others, incapacity substantiated deservedness. This panel includes multiple and varying populations of study: early nineteenth-century young adults trying to get into asylum schools, adults charged with legal incompetency, disabled Afro-Caribbean-American WWII veterans,  and Vietnam veterans experiencing the consequences of Agent Orange. By covering a long period of time—the early national period through the twenty-first century—the panel explores evolving questions of (in)equalities, deservedness, activism, and citizenship over time and community.   While these papers focuses on disparate populations and analyses, the themes of (in)capacitated citizenship weaves throughout all.  Individuals and activist groups seeking access to various opportunities and benefits often justified doing so through claims to citizenship. Conversely, legislators, medical experts, local legal officials, educational leaders, and others defined proper citizenship by all they did—and did so imbedded in ideologies of race, disability, gender, and family.  By enacting and implementing citizenship ideals institutionally, such institutions generated, affirmed, reinforced, and sometimes challenged (in)equalities.  All of these papers exemplify the use of disability as an analytical tool, and its inseparability from other structures of power. Organized chronologically, this panel begins with Laurel Daen. Daen examines disabled and impoverished young adults who made claims about their capacity for citizenship as they sought education. Kim Nielsens paper explores the claims and criteria by which adults under guardianship contested this legal limitation, and how ideologies of identity and power influenced such resistance.  Robert F. Jefferson, Jr. examines the pension claims filed by disabled Afro-Caribbean World War Two Ex-GIs and the strategies they devised to negotiate and challenge the racialist policies of the US Veterans Administration and the Immigration and Naturalization Service throughout the 1940s. Leslie J. Reagan examines how Vietnam War veterans struggle in the 1970s-80s for recognition of the damaging health effects of Agent Orange has become focused on obtaining a disability ranking from the VA.   Winning a disability ranking has become a veteran identity which brings with it respect and significant financial benefits.  Whether those veterans identify as disabled or as part of a community of people with disabilities, however, remains a complicated question.  The papers of this panel use a variety of primary sources, allowing for further deeper analyses of panel themes. These include legal, medical, activist, educational, and governmental sources. Building from these papers, this panel will explore questions such as: How have ideals of capacity and citizenship changed over time? How have social, governmental, and legal institutions defined capacity? How has individual and group resistance impacted standards of capacity and citizenship?  How can these examples help us understand current debates regarding the capacities required for U.S. citizenship? </p>","Contested Capacities, Contested Citizenship"

Yet as contingent faculty have become a fixture on the higher education landscape, making up well over half the academic labor force, historians and other scholars are beginning to ask if professional associations can do more to address contingent faculty concerns. While they differ in purpose and function from labor unions and other workplace organizations, can professional organizations be better advocates for those who face precarious employment in colleges and universities? Are professional organizations underserving this segment of their current or potential membership? Many of these questions about contingent faculty, the job crisis for historians, and the distinctive function of professional organizations were debated in an April/May 2019 Chronicle of Higher Education exchange between historians Daniel Bessner and Michael Brenes, American Historical Association Executive Director James Grossman, and Allison Miller.Panelists on this roundtable who will discuss professional organizations past and ongoing work to address contingent faculty concerns represent the Organization of American Historians, the American Historical Association, the Labor and Working-Class History Association, the Western History Association, and the American Association of University Professors. Members of the roundtable will engage questions about what professional organizations can and ought to do individually and collectively not only to mitigate contingent workers daily challenges, but to confront the steady degradation of academic work in higher education—an acute problem for contingent faculty, but one that affects other faculty and students alike.</p>","Contingent Academic Labor And Professional Associations"

Increased demands for more collaborative, interdisciplinary, and interactive modes of teaching and learning have helped draw attention to experiential learning as an opportunity to engage and retain marginalized students (Yeh, 2010). Experiential education can function as praxis of critical pedagogy by centering students in the development of a more socially just world (Breunig, 2005; Itin, 1999).Tailoring these broader pedagogical inquires to the study of history, experiential learning exercises offer endless opportunities to push the traditional boundaries of US history by bridging the divides between academia and the public, centering marginalized voices within the historical narrative, and teaching students to produce knowledge within the field. Our panel will use five brief case studies of project-based hands-on learning to ignite a conversation with audience members about nontraditional methods of teaching and learning in the history classroom. With the conference themes focus on inequalities, our case studies will highlight different methods (from sensory-driven to service-oriented) of engaging students in discussions of identity and power in the past. Dr. Seth Blumenthal will offer a model for incorporating serving learning in the political history courses to engage students in contemporary issues and activism in modern America. Dr. Kera Lovell brings the history classroom home, offering an exercise on family recipe reenactments to engage immigrant and first-generation college students in discussions of 20th century American history. Dr. Walter Greason, Dr. Ansley Erickson, and Dr. Julian Chambliss each offer different digital modes of teaching and learning that teach students how to inform diverse publics while creating empathic connections to different historical subjects. With an expansive background in grant-funded experiential learning projects, Greason sheds light on using immersive simulations, digital and physical, when teaching African American history. In working with graduate students, Erickson offers insight on how to use experiential learning assignments such as the creation of digital exhibits and blog posts to train graduate students on ethical challenges within the field. Finally, Chambliss discusses his work on the Urban Visionary Project—a semester-long digital timeline assignment allowing students to explore shifts in academic and cultural narratives on urbanization over time. Panelists will each provide a clear example of an experiential learning project used when teaching history. Each panelist will offer best tips for implementation, highlighting specific strategies for encouraging creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking that will enable audience members to walk away with a clear idea of how to adapt projects to their own classes.Taken together, the panel aims to invite a discussion with the audience on alternative modes of teaching that re-think traditional methods of experiencing the history classroom in ways that can not only center marginalized voices in the past, but also unsupported students and faculty in academias present.</p>","Critical Pedagogy &Amp; Experiential Learning: Experiments In Active Learning In The History Classroom"

From the foundations of American capitalist development to the racial wealth gap, scholars have begun, with renewed interest, to plumb the archives in search of new ways to analyze why wealth inequality continues to persist in American society along racial lines.  But, important questions remain.  What does the history of American slavery and emancipation reveal about modern wealth inequality?   More directly, what happens when we situate the history of modern capitalism within conversations about the lingering effects of bondage that continue to plague African-American communities?  Scholars—from political scientists to economists and sociologists—have started to investigate these questions.  However, there is more to be understood about how the history of slavery and freedom has influenced the current state of African-American economic life.  This panel features scholars whose work sits at the intersection of race and capitalism.  By shifting the conversation about economic inequality from the twentieth century to the nineteenth century and the period of legal slavery, members of this panel will consider the ways in which African Americans took advantage of, but were ultimately excluded from, full participation as economic agents in the promise of American financial prosperity.  Shennette Garrett-Scott will discuss the intersection of racial capitalism and gender by exploring the ways in which African American womens labor fulfilled the demand for low-cost clothing during the Civil War and Reconstruction.  She will show that elite Northern white women and members of the Freedmans Bureau who promised to train and employ black women workers ensured that they would never succeed economically as earners.  Garrett-Scott will investigate the economic challenges under which African-American women emerged out of slavery in the nineteenth century. Amanda Gibson will locate Elizabeth Keckley—the formerly enslaved dressmaker employed by Mary Todd Lincoln—within the history of credit, debt, and freedom in nineteenth-century America.  She argues that credit served as a crucial tool for enslaved people to purchase their freedom.  Moreover, free people of color believed that access to credit would protect them from the ubiquitous threat of re-enslavement.  Gibson concludes that former bondspeople, like Keckley, relied on the promise of credit and the burden of debt to finance their escapes from bonded servitude. Calvin Schermerhorn will reflect on one of the most enduring questions in the history of race and American capitalism: What is the relationship between the racial wealth gap and the vestiges of slavery?  By considering the last 400 years of American history, Schermerhorn offers an audacious argument about the genesis of economic inequality.  He contends that to fully understand how and why economic inequality hits African Americans disproportionately, we must understand the entire history of the American republic and the origins of modern American capitalism.   Ultimately, this panel will investigate how regimes that attempted to cripple the economic prospects of enslaved people and former slaves continued (and continues) to influence African Americans prosperity today.  </p>","Debt And Dispossession: Racial Capitalism And African American Economic Life In Historical Perspective"

The work is made even harder when global and not merely national contexts are taken into consideration.  This panel will bring together emerging and established scholars of American religion and politics for a conversation with the audience about terminology.  We will consider how an international perspective might alter how we think about they keywords of American religious history--most notably &quot;evangelical,&quot; &quot;ecumenical,&quot; and &quot;Christian&quot;--as well as some of the field&quot;s central frames, namely &quot;liberal versus conservative&quot; and &quot;religious versus secular.&quot;  Our aim is not so much to prove what can be gained from a fixed lexicon and more to highlight what is lost when we uncritically export the vocabularies of American religions to foreign lands.

The primary alternative paradigm embraced by radical economists was Dependency Theory, whose proponents argued that the economic underdevelopment of the Third World was the product of the siphoning of resources from the nations of the periphery by those of the capitalist core. Contrary to modernizations contention that integration into supranational networks of global capitalism would end the relative poverty of Third World nations, Dependistas argued that it was precisely their relationship with the global North which had distorted the economic growth of the nations of the global South, and which kept them in a state of perpetual underdevelopment.           Rooting dependency theory in the commodity price surge triggered by the Korean War, Tim Barkers paper looks at how Argentine economist Raul Prebischs articulation of dependency theory was guided by his study of this major postwar boom and bust. Drawing on the intellectual histories of Andre Gunder Frank and Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Margarita Fajardo pushes back against the notion that dependency can be wholly understood as a critique of modernization, arguing that dependency theory developed out of critiques of the economic orthodoxies of the global South. Writing on the transnational network of radical economists and sociologists affiliated with Chiles Centro de Estudios Socioeconomics (CESO) between 1968 and 1973, Cody Stephens illustrates that dependencys appeal was due to its epistemological and moral challenge to Washington-led modernization, rather than to rigorous empirical research. Benjamin Feldman looks at counternarratives to the micro-economic assumptions which undergirded modernizations naturalizing of consumer capitalism, engaging with radical economists who travelled from the United States to investigate moral and other forms of non-material incentives employed in Maoist China and Castroite Cuba.             In tracing the contours of Dependency theory and related alternative paths to economic development, this panel weaves together a series of overlapping intellectual histories which approach Dependency as an active project of research and discovery, rather than simply a reaction to currents in modernization theory. In so doing, these papers challenge dominant narratives of both the political-economic thought of the Third World Left and of the history of Cold War social science.</p>","Dependency And Other Intellectual Histories From The Global South"

The movement, which has emboldened women to speak up against harassment and discrimination, has resulted in the public downfall of dozens of powerful men. It has also inspired sister movements like #ChurchToo and #TimesUp, which seek to confront abuse and harassment within churches and gender discrimination in the workplace, respectively. Women have, of course, long labored toward asserting their rights, agency, and equality in public spaces. In many cases, their actions resulted in the downfall of powerful men. This panel brings together three such stories from American history to consider how women have organized and advocated for themselves generations before #MeToo.The first episode comes from 1830s New York City, where the Female Benevolent Society took issue with the tactics of Rev. John Robert McDowall, a fellow moral reformer, whose unusual zeal and exceedingly graphic anti-prostitution publishing enterprises worried the women who shared McDowalls overall goals but questioned his methods. Having begun working hand-in-hand with McDowall to rid the city of vice, the Female Benevolent Society grew impatient with the minister and charged him with promoting lewdness while claiming to work toward eliminating it. In 1834, the New York Presbytery found McDowall guilty of the charges and dismissed him from his post, thereby vindicating the more traditional approaches of the Society. The second episode takes place in Hunnewell, Kansas where--in 1911--a full-slate of female municipal officials unseated the small citys most powerful men. The women campaigned on maternalist rhetoric that emphasized womens innate morality and they broke new ground in seating the first female sheriff in American history. Hunnewells all-male city council sought to unseat them, however, and succeeded to a certain extent in burying their history, raising questions about politics, power, and historical memory. The third paper also takes up the question of historical memory regarding the case of Madge Oberholtzer. In 1925, Oberholtzer was raped and subsequently died from injuries inflicted by D.C. Stephenson, Grand Dragon of the Indiana Ku Klux Klan, but not before she could issue damning testimony that ensured his conviction and the downfall of the KKK. Indianapolis locals questioned Oberholtzers reputation at the time of her death, but her story has been oft-repeated as evidence of the Klans brutality and Stephensons snake-like charm. Together, these stories reveal a long history of womens campaigns for their rights and for religious, social, and political influence in contexts which at first appeared impossible in their strictures. Panel chair Dr. Patricia Cline Cohen will offer a brief response to each paper and comment on these episodes in womens history.</p>","Difficult Females: The Women Who Brought Down Powerful Men Before #Metoo"

In their framing, the cultural turn of the 1980s and 90s pursued a semiotic direction that focused on smaller-scale stories rather than allowing historians to address pressing contemporary policy issues at larger structural levels. Digital history, according to The History Manifesto, can serve as a corrective by taking advantage of advances in computational power. They can bring the macrohistorical and statistical approach of the Annales School&quot;s longue durée back into play. Is this polemical contrast between digital and cultural history accurate? This roundtable consists of digital history practitioners with interests in culture. We step back to ask: where does cultural history stand after the digital turn? Are there ways to combine cultural and digital history? What has become of the digital dream shared by both History Manifesto writers and most cultural historians—what early adopters such as Roy Rosenzweig described as an effort to democratize access to history? The panel uses the digital itself in its form: our six participants—Jessica Marie Johnson, Maria Cotera, Rhae Lynn Barnes, Lauren Tilton, Scott Saul, and chair Michael Kramer—each screen five-minute videos about their research and the implications of it for digital cultural history. Jessica Marie Johnson focuses on her work in Black Code Studies, which she describes as an articulation of black digital practice as it appears and disappears from the archive and from the screen. Maria Cotera presents Chicana por mi Raza, an online interactive archive of oral histories and material culture documenting Chicana Feminist praxis from 1965-1985 that reimagines the archive as a collective and multi-generational space of encuentro in which participants exchange information, create new forms of knowledge, and bridge the gap between present and past, the academy and the community, scholarship and activism. Based on the experience of having her DH website U.S. History Scene suspended and temporarily removed from search engines, Rhae Lynn Barnes explores what happens when algorithms, robot scanners, and image recognition software censor an open source, online American cultural digital history curriculum. Lauren Tilton explains how computational techniques such as machine learning and computer vision are opening up new possibilities for scholarship in visual culture studies. With his &quot;Berkeley Revolutions&quot; course and collaborative project, Scott Saul traces the pedagogical links that can be made between research in analog archives, the practice of oral history, and the production of digital history. Michael J. Kramer turns to the potential of data&quot;s ductility to expand the aural and musical dimensions of historical inquiry in his Image Sonification for Historical Interpretation research, and in doing so raises questions about how we understand the Annales School&quot;s tripartite system of temporality. After the videos are screened, the roundtable opens up for extended conversation among panelists and audience members to probe the stakes of digital cultural history as a mode of inquiry into the past.</p>","Digital Cultural History: A Roundtable"

Jeannette Eileen Jones, Nadia Nurhussein, Nemata Blyden, and John Gruesser have been working on a collaborative research project that seeks to explore the history of US engagement with Africa during the so-called age of empire (c. 1870-1919). From the United States diplomatic recognition of Liberia in 1862 to the end of the Paris Peace Conference, which led to the redistribution of the German African colonies, Americans engaged with Africa and Africans in varied roles—as emigrants, missionaries, plenipotentiaries, travelers, and merchants. Some Americans who traveled to Africa recorded their impressions in travel narratives, diaries, and letters to editors of various newspapers. These Americans and others who did not travel to Africa, imagined Africa and Africans in poems, novels, short stories, and drama. In analyzing this range of primary sources, the collaborators employ historical and literary approaches to answer questions about human actions, events, and cultural production as framed by the project.To what extent did American involvement in Africa complicate U.S. race-making and sense of its place in the world? How did those activities impact US diplomacy and imperialist ambitions? To what extent did the Negro Question—the debate over the status of Blacks in the US—determine the ways in which Americans would interact with Africans and Africa? How did the age of empire condition and transform American diplomacy vis-à-vis Africa? When, where, why, and how did the United States encounter Africa during Americas Gilded Age and Progressive Era? How did American cultural, political, and literary ideas about Africa transform during the European scramble for Africa? How did American racial discourses and expansionist aims condition the ways in which Americans encountered Africans and European imperialists in Africa? How did Africans respond to the presence of Americans?The goal of TEAA is to reveal little known patterns of American movement across Africa in the context of broader American ideas about the continent that emerged during the Gilded Age and Progressive Era. Specifically, TEAA places those actions in dialogue with the African Question—a body of political discourses that emerged during the mid-nineteenth century that sought to articulate the meaning and relevance of Africa in an increasingly Eurocentric interconnected world, that is, political thought that focused primarily on the relationship between Africa and Europe, but held implications for broader formulations of empire, race, and national identities—key themes in humanist scholarship. The collaborators argue that scholars have overlooked, underestimated, and understudied this relationship particularly in the historical context of US expansion and empire.In discussing the project, the participants will explain the digital humanities methods and tools used in the project. They will also dialogue about the strengths and limitations of using such tools. The chair/moderator, Kalenda Eaton, who is a member of the Humanities Advisory Board for TEAA, will posed questions to the participants and open up the floor for audience Q &amp; A.</p>","Digital Humanities Approaches To Visualizing America In Africa During The Age Of Empire"

Disability, these historians have shown, is central to understanding U.S. history, but this centrality and significance rarely translates to the U.S. history classroom. This roundtable seeks a useable past and aims to start a conversation about how we can begin to incorporate disability histories as we teach U.S. history.<br>As a starting point, presenters will discuss disability in the the classroom in four distinct contexts. Drawing on her experience teaching at public and private universities, session chair Jenifer L. Barclay, Assistant Professor of History at the University at Buffalo, will both moderate the conversation and review her experiences helping undergraduates to use the critical disability lens as a tool in understanding and assessing the changing power structures of American society. Sarah F. Rose, Associate Professor of History at University of Texas at Arlington, will discuss her work centering disability history in a required historical research methods course at University of Texas at Arlington, where she has used disability to engage a diverse group of students in the work of historians. Hannah Greene, doctoral candidate at New York Universitys Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, will examine how the public charge provision in U.S. immigration policy, which mandated deportation of immigrants in part on the basis of disability and illness, offers a critical way to integrate disability history in broader discussions of U.S. history. Finally, Ashley Shew, Assistant Professor in the Department of Science, Technology, and Society at Virginia Tech, and Monique Dufour, Collegiate Assistant Professor of History at Virginia Tech, will discuss how intersectional disability history has become central to Virginia Techs popular interdisciplinary minor, &quot;Medicine and Society,&quot; through courses such as Technology and Disability, History of Medicine, and War and Medicine. Presenters will share their experiences researching, integrating and centering disability history in a range of broader U.S. histories in the classroom, and building assignments, curriculum, courses, and programs. Ultimately, this session will provide the foundation for an important conversation about integrating disability into the classroom—as an analytical tool and an important, but understudied aspect of the human experience. This session seeks to draw attention to the centrality of disability in U.S. history, disabilitys usefulness as a category of analysis, and disabilitys power in the classroom and in programs, while challenging narratives of U.S. history that fail to contend with disability.</p>","Disability In U.S. History: Integrating Disability History"

Yet, even as scholars have amassed a growing body of work on disabled vets, it is clear that much more work needs to be done. This panel brings together examples of some of the latest work on disabled veterans. It moves beyond better-known aspects of disabled veterans history to examine disabled vets whose histories have thus far been ignored by the vast majority of scholars.&nbsp;<br>Sarah Handley-Cousins examines the intersection of (fears of) disability, criminality, and veteran identity in decades following the U.S. Civil War. Picking up about twenty years later, Evan Sullivan argues that despite the complex neurological and physical wounds suffered by blinded veterans in World War I, news and rehabilitation articles promoted a sanitized image of the blinded Great War veteran as a means of motivating other disabled soldiers to make good. John Kinder looks at similar ideas of performative patriotism and sympathy, arguing that zoos throughout the United States regularly hosted blinded veterans to promote a culture of thankfulness, temporarily acknowledging physical and mental ailments while downplaying the permanent nature of injuries. The three papers more broadly seek to show how war prompts re-conceptualizations of the concept of disability in society, ultimately exploring the value systems of soldiers and civilians alike.</p>","Disabled Veterans, New Histories"

Anthony Amendment, which enfranchised many—but not all—American women. In the aftermath of the 19th Amendment, many activist women, recognizing both the remaining limitations on womens rights and the new possibilities created by woman suffrage, intensified their efforts to gain truly equal citizenship and to use their newly-won rights to address remaining inequalities both at home and abroad. Each of the papers in this panel examines the diverse ways in which women sought equality and influence in the 1920s and 1930s. Ann Short Chirhart examines Mary McLeod Bethunes campaign to use black womens voting power to contest white supremacy and racial violence in the American South. Anya Jabour explores Sophonisba Breckinridges work with the League of Women Voters, the U.S. Childrens Bureau, and the Immigrants Protective League to promote what she called true equality by insisting on equal rights, special protections, and independent citizenship for working women, poor mothers, and female immigrants. Caroline Waldron Merithew focuses on transnational networks of women who built on relationships forged in the suffrage movement to combat fascism in Italy. In different ways, these discussions of womens activism demonstrate that women activists built upon the feminist networks created during the suffrage movement to sustain multifaceted and multigenerational organizing.These papers also call attention to the diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and strategies of women activists. Lacking support from white feminists, Bethune and other African American women built their own networks to campaign—often unsuccessfully—for voting rights for black women. Although they collaborated with liberal and progressive activists, transnational activists tended toward radical or socialist politics. Breckinridge, who never married, instead spending forty-five years in a committed same-sex relationship, functioned predominantly in single-sex womens organizations and womens networks but also collaborated with male politicians, unionists, and social workers.Collectively, these papers highlight both the diversity of women activists and the diversity of the issues that engaged their interests in modern America.</p>","Diverse Women, Diverse Paths: Woman Suffrage And Equal Citizenship In Modern America"

The National Collaborative for Womens History Sites promotes the diversification of historic sites throughout the United States through the incorporation of women from diverse backgrounds. Currently, the Collaborative is creating a Tool Kit to guide site staff in researching and implementing gender-integrated interpretive programs and exhibits. In this Roundtable, staff, volunteers and scholars from a range of sites will offer practical examples of diversifying the stories we tell there and discuss issues critical to such transformative projects.  Diana Pardue, Chief of Museum Services at the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, has worked with American Indians, African Americans, immigrants, and women (as well as historians of each group) to enrich exhibits and tours. She will discuss the many roles women played at Ellis Island—immigrants, social workers, medical workers, and INS service staff—as well as the ways that particular groups of women have used the Statue of Liberty as a site of commemoration and protest. Jean Ellis, co-chair of Keweenaw Heritage Center in Michigan, will trace the development of the exhibit Discover a Womans Place for the 100th anniversary of a miners strike in Calumet Township. Since most exhibits and tours at this site focus on male miners, Ellis and three volunteer coworkers used census, hospital and church records, newspapers and oral histories, to find the women in Calumet and innovative (and necessarily inexpensive) techniques to bring their diverse stories to life.  Camesha Scruggs, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, worked as an intern at the Abraham Lincoln Home Site in Illinois and as an intern at the W. E. B. DuBois National Historic Site in Massachusetts. She will explore efforts to integrate the stories of women, especially laboring women, into such male-centered sites. Several women worked at Abraham Lincolns Springfield home between 1840 and 1860, while it is the life and labors of DuBoiss mother that can help us understand her sons accomplishments. Scruggs will also discuss Elizabeth Freeman, whose journey to freedom began at Ashley House, an historic home near the DuBois site in Great Barrington. Dr. Lesley Barker served as Executive Director of the Bolduc House Museum in Ste.

This roundtable asks to examine this important historiographical developments, highlighting the rich diversity contain in this field and brainstorming ways to enhance its recognition. We will address how the chronological framework of this period intersects with other scholarly thematic interests, like gender, race, empire, capitalism, labor, etc., and how these thematic perspectives enable us to think more critically on this period. What types of new knowledge can we uncover by taking into account questions of race, gender, and sexuality? How do issues of access and privilege construct the mainstream narratives we tell about this period? Why some scholars, despite focusing on the period, do not identify as scholars of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era? We will ask how can we, as a professional organization and as individual scholars, contribute to diversifying the field, and to what extent scholarly collaborations and the association has allowed more diverse perspectives about the period to emerge? Representing the range of scholars and topics this field encompasses, the panelists will offer their insights on how their work contribute to our understanding of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era as a field and its diversity.

Justice struggles themselves have also been inherently unequal contests – clashes between the powerful and the powerless. US activists, visionaries, and other troublemakers have often faced staggering odds and incurred violent retributions for their actions. But while their demands seemed impossibly utopian to their contemporaries, on occasion, actions from below have transformed the inconceivable into the inevitable.Our current historical moment features many, overlapping crises with deep roots in our collective past and scarce hope to offer for our collective future. Mass incarceration, family separation, growing economic inequality, emergent white nationalism, permanent warfare, catastrophic climate change, and more drive a politics of panic, cruelty, and despair. As political leadership in the US and beyond veers toward authoritarianism, historically loaded terms, such as fascism and nationalism, once all but relegated to history books and political hyperbole, have returned to both scholarly and mainstream discourse.With this context in mind, this roundtable will explore what history has to offer in dispiriting times, namely the seeds of change that activist-author Rebecca Solnit calls hope in the dark and panelist Annelise Orleck calls flashes of hope. Drawing from their research and years of teaching experience, panelists will discuss the acts of extraordinary bravery, ingenuity, and solidarity that have countered hopelessness and engaged everyday Americans in efforts to build a more just and humane world. In doing so, the panel will offer insight into the unpredictable nature of history, the resilience of the human spirit, and, perhaps, some hope for future that we must build together. Jesse Hagopian, Ethnic studies teacher at Seattles Garfield High School, will discuss the Black Lives Matter at School movement of students and educators that has emerged in recent years to counter privatization, institutional racism, and the school-to-prison pipeline.Dana Frank, Professor of History Emerita at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will discuss mass movements power in numbers and explore the reality that in dark times, people often find intrinsic joy in participating in the struggle.Annelise Orleck, Professor of History, Women&quot;s Gender and Sexuality Studies and Jewish Studies at Dartmouth College, will examine movement history as not only peak moments of protest waves but also as trough periods of organizing work needed to sustain subsequent waves. She will do so through the lens of a revived labor movement both in the US and around the world that, following four decades of falling real wages, is demanding wage increases and taking increasing action to stop sexual violence in the workplace.Dawson Barrett, Assistant Professor of US History at Del Mar College, will moderate the discussion. </p>","Dont Mourn, Organize!

These four papers contribute to a growing body of scholarship that situates the history of education within its broader social and political context, and rethinks the role of educational policy in shaping local, state, and federal governance and political economy. Schools - how they were funded, where they were located, who they served, and their ideological and political promise - were central to the creation and operation of residential segregation, regressive tax regimes, unequal labor markets, and regional economic development that favored business elites over residents. These four papers explore several key moments of contestation over the expansion of publicly-financed education in the 20th century in different regions of the United States, revealing underlying conflicts about what role schools should play in society, and their role in shaping new social and economic disparities. Focusing on northern California in the early 20th century, Matt Kelly considers the role of state public finance policies on financial disparities between school districts. Shifting to the East Coast in the same era, Cristina Groeger examines the relationship between employers anti-union open-shop movement and their reliance on a new feminized clerical workforce, largely trained in public schools. Moving to the Midwest in the late 20th century, Kelly Goodman explores the role of organized teachers and labor leaders in pushing for more equitable systems of school finance, to address both economic and racial disparities, between the tax revolts in 1960s cities and 1970s states. Finally, turning to the South, William Goldsmith examines the political leaders in North Carolina who championed investment in human capital as essential to their program of Southern economic development, with policy consequences at the national level in the 1980s and 1990s. Nancy Beadie, expert in the history of school funding and the role of education in both economic development and state formation, will serve as commentator and chair. By situating educational policy in distinct regions within broader contexts of social, economic, and political trends, these papers offer new explanations for the persistent educationalization of social problems. These papers show diverse ways in which, throughout the twentieth century, despite a longstanding faith in education as the great equalizer, educational policy has undergirded new structures of social inequality in the U.S. The panel as a whole seeks to shape new narratives about social inequality in the United States, with education playing a leading role.</p>","Education And Social Inequality In The Long 20th Century"

At the same time, national leaders increasingly came to see education in global terms, as a system that could be exported to overseas territories, with potential consequences for matters of economic and political power and influence internationally.   By 1907, some of the same federal officials who promoted a national system of education in the U.S. in the 1870s and 80s were busy spreading the empire of free education in Puerto Rico and the Philippines.  What was the relationship between these projects?  How did educators and political leaders frame those connections?  How did efforts to export educational institutions and structures overseas play out and with what consequences? What was the practical economic and political significance of education in the historical exercise of global economic and imperial power and how did those dynamics carry over into the 20th century?In a 2016 historiographical essay, the historian Paul Kramer suggested politics of capitalism as a frame for connecting more localized and nationalized histories of American capitalism outward.  Seeking to bring together two different, but currently vibrant and potentially complementary, historiographies on the history of capitalism and the history of imperialism, Kramer argued for reframing the effort as a project of political-economic history.  Such an approach, he suggested, would allow historians to denaturalize economic relations, recapture the politics of capitalism, and trace imperial trajectories both within and across national boundaries.  Kramer himself, as part of outlining the potential of that project and also as part of his larger body of work, identified education as operating within that transnational political space. And yet, a focused analysis of the significance of education in relation to the politics of capitalism and imperialism remains a largely unmet challenge.  This session addresses that challenge.  Tracing imperial trajectories between and within the U.S., Spain, Argentina, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico, the four papers presented here focus on the significance of education in several types of economic relationships, including: global commodity markets, international labor markets, and colonialism.  They also uncover some surprising and somewhat counterintuitive relationships within and across national boundaries and across time. For example, although the significance of education in international economic development is often conceived as a late 20th century policy concern, papers by Beadie and Cantos analyze 19th century versions of such imperial policies in the U.S. and Spain upon which later policies built.  At the same time, papers presented by Lefty and Leroux complicate our understanding of such policies by challenging common assumptions about the direction of influence, for example highlighting the efforts of Argentine elites to invite US educational influence  and the influence of U.S. colonial experience in Puerto Rico on domestic U.S. education and economic policy at home.</p>","Education And The Politics Of Global Capitalism:   Tracing Imperial Trajectories From The Late 19th Through The Mid-20th Centuries"

Very few, however, have scrutinized the narrative form itself, the social construction of the genre, and its role in crafting colonial discourse. Travelers rarely recorded unmediated experience, but instead gazed at new environments and people through the eyes of previous sojourners. Indeed, the reading of narratives by those who came before them preconditioned travelers to apprehend exotic environments and peoples in ways that profoundly shaped their own experiences and structured their own stories. Our proposed panel, Encounters with Natives and Nature: Travel Narratives and American Ideologies, focuses on travelers who narrated their journeys along the Overland Trails, across the Isthmus of Panama, and down the Colorado River to explore the ways in which they constructed those accounts and in the process created national narratives that legitimated conquest, from the nineteenth century well into the twenty-first. These mediated narratives had long-term consequences. Settler Discourse in Travel Writing: Overland by Foot, Wagon, and Rail, by PhD candidate Christopher Smith (University of Oregon), will demonstrate that the published diaries and narratives of the overland journey through the American West promulgated settler-colonial ideologies of place, race, and the ownership of the land that live on to this day. Crossing at Panama: Patterns of Tropical Perception during the Isthmian Transit Period, by Paul Sutter (Professor, University of Colorado-Boulder), will argue that travel narratives of the trans-Panama journey laid the foundation for tropicality as an American ideology of extra-continental expansion. And Danger River: Narrating Adventure through the Southwestern Canyonlands, by Marsha Weisiger (Associate Professor, University of Oregon), will show how diaries and published narratives expressed the frontier ideology that continues to undergird wilderness environmentalism. Mark Fiege (Professor, Montana State University) will serve as chair, and Thomas Hallock, a literary historian who has written on frontier travel narratives, will comment before opening up 25 minutes of conversation with the audience.</p>","Encounters With Natives And Nature: Travel Narratives And American Ideologies"

The theme that unites this panel is abolition. The first paper explores the relationship between former abolitionists and Russian terrorists and argues that the similarities in John Browns infamous raid in 1859 and the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881—both committed, ostensibly, to spark the uprising of an oppressed people—caused many former abolitionists to defend regicide in Russia. The second paper investigates how abolitionists connection with the failed revolutions of 1848 increased southern nativism and the regions hostility toward ideas of universal equality, seeing them as radical, foreign imports. The final paper also shows how foreign connections strengthened anti-abolitionist arguments in the United States and traces the white slavery discourse of British Chartists and how it fueled anti-abolitionism in northern labor groups. This panel therefore investigates the different ways that a diverse group of Americans debated the twin questions of equality and freedom. Southerners rejected abolitions dedication to universal equality and northern laborers concerned themselves only with the plight of white slaves in ways that carefully excluded African-Americans from full equality. In contrast, former abolitionists dedication to those very same slaves made them sympathetic to the plight of 100 million Russian subjects who were bound and gagged by Tsarist autocracy. Taken together, this research offers new insights into the ways that Americans embraced and/or rejected transatlantic ideas, and how these foreign theories shaped an age-old question in the United States—who deserves equality?</p>","Equality For Whom?

Today farmers account for less than two percent of the population. Panelists explore different ways that farmers have been mythologized over 100 years, from the 1870s to the 1970s. Two papers address the process by which physically demanding farm work became devalued and romanticized, and the consequences for people at two ends of the food spectrum - consumers and agricultural laborers. Two papers address the ways that special interest groups (agribusiness and environmentalists) manipulated public policy, and the consequences for rural communities and sustainability.Each panelist considers the realities as well as the myths, specifically the ways that race, class, and policy helped create recognizable commodities that not all could access. They provide examples of how popular culture and policy vilified laborers; undermined ideals of communitarianism in traditional practices; increased competition over land, labor and access to capital; and served consumer goals more than laborers goals of subsistence. The places and temporal scope of the papers range from postbellum Louisiana, World-War-II-era Georgia, the post-World-War-II Midwest and Cold-War-era plains states. Collectively these papers document factors that affect public understanding of food production, and they itemize consequences of the myths. Namely, consequences ranged from the extinction of seed saving, the devaluing of agricultural labor, and a preference for policy that disadvantaged agricultural laborers and served growers and consumers intent on inexpensive foods.</p>","Food Producers: Popular Perceptions And Food Security From Reconstruction To The Farm Crisis"

Many have celebrated the ways immigrant foods have not only facilitated the belonging of newcomers, but educated and enlightened white consumers, whose changing culinary habit are deemed evidence of a new cosmopolitanism. However, food has also been a source of division, drawing boundaries and re-inscribing hierarchies. As food workers, laboring in fields, factories, plants, and restaurants, as well as consumers, immigrants have sought justice as much as a paycheck or a familiar meal. In doing so, they created new channels of procurement that circumvented U.S. customs and expectations about what constituted safe foods, tested ideas about citizenship and sources of urban poverty, as well as highlighted connections between environmental protections, consumer security, and labor conditions.</p>","Food, Immigration, And Inequality In The 20th Century"

The panelists explore a variety of interrelated themes; each of which highlight what is unique and urgent about demands for equality and decolonization in Puerto Rico today. Individual papers consider the history of the Puerto Rico within the broader historiography of the U.S. carceral state, the historiographic impact of anti-communism in histories of Puerto Rican community organizing, as well as the often-overlooked role of Puerto Rican participation in the U.S. welfare rights movement.  Together these papers build a dialogue that explores how ideas about equality and inequality have been mobilized throughout Puerto Rican history as well as the dynamic ways that Puerto Rican people have sought social transformation within and beyond U.S. empire. These papers also examine the challenges faced by political organizers who have both demanded rights from the U.S. while also challenging U.S. imperial control or the legacies of colonialism in their communities.  One of the aims of our conversation will be to tease out inequalities with roots in  the pre-1898 period in relationship to ones that have emerged as a result of U.S. occupation and exploitation.  Our dialogue will consider what the role of the U.S. is in Puerto Rican struggles for equality as well as a collective critical examination of the uses of the language of equality in Puerto Rico.  The panel will be chaired by Lorrin Thomas, a leading scholar of Puerto Rican and Latinx history whose has written about Puerto Rican citizenship and belonging in the United States.

The obvious solution to historic patterns of exclusion was the inclusion of African Americans into the benefits of the so-called affluent society. In the realm of housing, the end of exclusion meant that the federal government ended its decades-long policy of redlining and locking out prospective black homeowners from the multiple federal programs designed to expand homeownership. But inclusion into conventional real estate practices did not end rampant racial discrimination in the rental or ownership markets. It also did not result in the democratization of banking, lending or general access to conventional sources of credit. Indeed, decades after the end of federal redlining, African Americans continue to face systemic obstacles to safe, sound and secure housing. This reality compels scholars to not only examine patterns of exclusion but to shift our focus to examine the institutions and real estate practices and policy into which African Americans were included at the end of the 1960s to understand this persistence of racialized housing inequality. This session examines the ways that ingrained patterns of racial discrimination within the real estate and banking industries and within the Department of Housing and Urban Development continued to perpetuate patterns racial discrimination even after laws banned the practice.&nbsp;</p>","From Exclusion To Inclusion: U.S. Housing After Federal Redlining"

The current scholarship, dominated by political scientists, demands the archival analysis and nuanced narratives that historians bring to the study of politics. This roundtable will consider the fundamental themes, questions, and tensions that will guide the new historiography of black politics in the 1980s and 1990s. The panel is composed of scholars of black liberalism, radicalism, and conservatism who examine politics at the local, national, and international scales. Panelists will discuss a variety of topics within four distinct though intersecting areas of focus: electoral politics, black political thought, social movements, and transnational politics. The panelists will consider how African Americans engaged in electoral politics in a political landscape transformed by Reagan. Possible discussion points include the presidential campaigns of Jesse Jackson; the successes and failures of Virginia governor Douglas Wilder and others at the state level; and developments in black urban governance in cities such as Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and Chicago. The discussion of black political thought will focus on the remakings of black conservatism, liberalism, and radicalism in the post-civil rights era. Topics include the ascent of black conservatives to national attention and positions of power; evolving black liberalism and African American engagement with an increasingly conservative Democratic Party; and transformations within black radicalism within renewed struggles against imperialism and the revival of Afrocentrism in black culture. We will also examine debates concerning affirmative action, welfare, criminal justice, and the salience of race that circulated in both the mainstream and black public sphere in the 1980s and 1990s. The roundtable will also consider the evolution of the dynamic social movements of the 1970s into the 1980s and 1990s. Topics include the grassroots movement against apartheid, the Million Man and Million Woman Marches, and mobilization against police brutality. We will discuss theories of widespread political demobilization, which several political scientists have suggested, and will also consider how black leadership developed in the post-civil rights era.Lastly, participants will discuss black transnational politics both in and outside formal government and across the ideological spectrum. Topics could include the movement against South African apartheid, responses to the Haitian refugee crisis, and grassroots movements against imperialism in Africa, the Middle East, and the Caribbean. The panel will consider how black transnational politics evolved in the era of globalization as well as the new ways black Americans both challenged and participated in imperial projects across the world.Questions about the limits of equality and the intransigence of inequality drive this panel. By many measures, conditions for African Americans are as bad or even worse than they had been at the onset of the post-civil rights era. How does this new history of black politics help us better understand persistent inequalities both interracially and intra-racially? With the audience, we hope to address these questions and discover new areas of inquiry as we expand the historiography of African American politics. </p>","From Politics To Protest: Charting The New Historiography Of Black Politics In The 1980s And 1990s"

More specifically, our panel addresses these issues in Texas during the late twentieth century when conservative tendencies across the state stood firmly in the way of liberal progress. In one paper presentation, Dr. Peter Martínez discusses some of the difficulties that people of Mexican descent have had in claiming socio-political equality by virtue of equal representation in municipal governance. Even today, as millions of Mexican immigrants have crossed the border, with or without documentation, Mexicans fight for the rights of citizenship, even if legal citizenship has already been granted. While white conservative Americans often attempt to suppress Mexican political power, and liberal white Americans frequently take power with claims that they are able to suitably represent Mexican interests, Mexicans themselves have struggled to take power and hold power, much less gain power. Next, Dr. Karen Wiselys research digs into legal equality for the LGBTQ community in North Texas. Like Mexican-American issues, LGBTQ rights have been in the forefront of national headlines over the past few years, but the fight for equal recognition by state and federal laws eludes the LGBTQ community. In this particular paper, Dr. Wisely narrows down the research into Texas legal codes that criminalize homosexual behavior, thus effectively making it more difficult to live a lifestyle in accordance to ones beliefs and preferences. Furthermore, by enacting these laws and arresting gay men in disproportionate numbers, Texas has a history of essentially attempting to prevent gay behavior from entering the public realm.Finally, Dr. Roy Vũ, the child of Vietnamese refugees himself, will present research over some of the struggles experienced by Vietnamese refugees in the late twentieth century in Texas. As a result of the Vietnam War, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese immigrants made their way into the United States in the 1970s, a nation that had severely limited (and often eliminated) Asian immigration for most of the twentieth century until immigration legislation passed just a decade earlier. As though the struggle to establish oneself in a new nation was not difficult enough, Dr. Vũs research explores some of the difficulty that Vietnamese refugees faced in losing a second home and community in Houston, Texas as a result of American capitalism and gentrification in a large Euro-American led city.Each of the aforementioned presentations will address (In)Equality, whether the issue be equal representation, equality before state law, or equal opportunity for immigrants.

And yet, in the long years leading up to the passage of the 19th Amendment, compromises were made and many women remained disenfranchised -- many for generations. From May 2019 through August 2020, the National Park Service is commemorating the centennial of the ratification and passage of the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution. Using the 19th Amendment as a springboard, the agency is exploring the inequalities that spurred public action to advocate for womens access to the vote and the inequalities that persisted afterwards. Many arguments for and against suffrage hinged on who was considered a US citizen, and what rights that entailed. Using places across the country where this history took place, the NPS connects the decades of grassroots organizing for the womans vote through Reconstruction to the successes of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the 1968 Civil Rights Act.

The roundtable participants will each provide a brief introduction, explaining what their research has revealed about the particular assumptions, experiences, and contestations over bathrooms and breaks. Coreen Derifield analyzes the restroom in post-World War II Midwest factories as a space for women to connect and develop a gendered collective consciousness. Beth English investigates issues of policy, privacy, and rights in a 1960s struggle between AT&amp;T and its workers and their union over cameras in the bathrooms. Joey Fink considers how age, ability, sexual reproduction, and illness shaped workers needs and demands in southern textile mills in the 1970s. Robin Muhammad uses a comparative frame to reveal how African American women in segregated industries in World War I and II fought to equalize the workplace and used bathroom breaks for temporary but critical reclamation of their personal time. Chair Bryant Simon will offer responses and prompts and moderate the discussion. While the participants bring their own areas of expertise and focus to the table, audience members are encouraged to imagine &quot;workplace&quot; broadly and stretch the conversation across time, place, labor forces, and issues. The central topic of this roundtable lends itself well to questions of equality and inequality, human rights and abuses, and struggles between the powerful and vulnerable. It encourages considerations of change and continuity, universal themes and historical particularities, and how historians can research, theorize, and respect the most intimate aspects of the lives of the people they study. </p>","Give Me A Break: A Roundtable On Workers, Bathrooms, And Breaks In The U.S. Workplace"

Vanessa May, Associate Professor of History at Seton Hall, and Hannah Ontiveros, graduate student in History at Duke University, will examine the role of American women in carrying out gendered political work on a global stage.  Ontiveros will explore how the American government deployed women workers in Korea and used gendered rhetoric to justify American presence after the Korean War.  Womens gendered work in Korea allowed American policymakers to frame foreign intervention in Korea as unofficial reform rather than as part of a drive for global hegemony.  May will also interrogate gendered politics, examining how gendered rhetoric about womens Progressive Era reform worked to sideline maternalist policymakers in the 1950s and 1960s.  Through an examination of debates over child labor, May will demonstrate the impact of this gendered political shift from maternalists to liberals in designing policy for women and children, especially in terms of whether to expose minors to unskilled labor markets.  Melissa Estes Blair, Assistant Professor of History at Auburn University, on the other hand, adds a critical dimension to this panel in finding that, even at the height of the 1950s, presidential campaigns largely denied that women had any specific political interests, even as they produced campaign material targeted at female voters.  At its heart, this panel will examine where and how gendered politics did (and did not) play out, demonstrating the impact these gendered politics had on inequalities between nations, between classes, and between men and women.  By drawing attention to the multifaceted nature of womens government work, their successes as well as their failures, at a time of gender conservatism, the panel complicates our understanding of the midcentury federal state.  This panel highlights contested understandings of women, their appropriate roles in government and politics, and how gender shaped policy. Reckoning with womens participation in a wide variety of government work in this era deepens historical depictions of empire, liberal policymaking, and electoral politics. Robyn Muncy, Professor of History and Director of the Honors Program at the University of Maryland, who has written extensively on womens politics, naming womens Progressive-Era power in social welfare reform a female dominion, will comment.  Melissa Soto-Schwartz, professor of history and womens studies at Cuyahoga Community College, will chair the panel.</p>","Government Mobilizing Women And Women Mobilizing Government In The Mid-20th Century"

The presenters will discuss a range of cooperative models in which documentarians and historians have shared tasks or draw on mutual expertise. These efforts range from research, scripting, and contextualizing to script and rough-cut review for films that bring to light less well-known subjects in the history of movements for social justice. The session will appeal to scholars who are interested in both the subject matter and the process of historical documentary making, including those who have been invited to advise film projects and wish to know more about the process. In addition to exploring distinctions in historical research methods for film and for print, the panelists will address the role of historians as advisors and on-screen commentators, the varied audiences they intend to reach, and their educational goals in uncovering past social justice movements. We envision a total of five panelists and a chair, but two of the invitees were unable to provide their materials in time for this submission. We believe that we will be able to complete a well-rounded panel in the near future. At present, three participants have confirmed.PANELISTSRandall MacLowry will discuss the making of The Mine Wars, his 2017 Erik Barnouw Award-winning documentary about the United Mine Workers in early-twentieth century West Virginia. He will discuss how historians influenced the film in two capacities. The late James Green wrote the book that inspired the film (The Devil Is Here in These Hills: West Virginia&quot;s Coal Miners and Their Battle for Freedom, 2015) and served as the main consultant on the film throughout the process. In addition, other historians became advisers who provided feedback on proposals and script treatment as well as reviewing multiple cuts of the film. MacLowry will also draw on his wide experiences working with historians on episodes of the PBS series American Experience. Christie Herring and Estelle Freedman will discuss the process of collaborating on a biographical documentary film, Faith Petric: Singing for Justice, which explores continuity in social justice movements from the depression to the early twentieth century through the life of a travelling musician and activist. The film draws on the extensive personal archive of print, audio, and visual sources for Petric, a folksinger and lifelong progressive anti-war, racial justice, and womens rights activist who lived from 1915 to 2013. Inspired by an oral history conducted by Freedman, the film explores Petrics life as a peace activist in the 1930s, a ship worker during World War II, a single mother and fellow traveler during the Cold War, a marcher in Selma, a Wobbly, and a member of Women in Black and the Raging Grannies. The panelists will compare the research process for film versus print, the use of visual and musical sources to provide both historical context and content, and the process of collaboration.</p>","Historians And Filmmakers Documenting Resistance"

Vann Woodward presented to the Impeachment Inquiry of the House Committee on the Judiciary, at its request, a report on the misconduct of presidents and their senior officials.  The report covered the misdeeds for which executive offices had been charged, as well as their responses to the charges, from the administration of George Washington through that of Lyndon Johnson.  In the context of the nations present crisis, that report has been updated.The proposed panel grows from the expanded report. The panel chair contributed to the 1974 report and has directed its 2019 up-dating.  The panelists are all authors of fresh essays in the new report, which extends through the administration of Barack Obama and, at the time of the panel, will have appeared as Presidential Misconduct: From George Washington to Today (The New Press, 2019).The panel is designed to provide reflections on presidential misconduct over the entire span of American constitutional government since 1789.  The panelists, all scholars of the presidency, will offer comparisons of presidential scandals (especially between the administrations of Richard Nixon and Donald Trump), reflections on what constitutes a presidential scandal, and consideration of changing standards of misconduct and laws to prevent malfeasance.  They will also consider the roles, civic as well as professional, that historians can play and have played in helping to hold presidents and other public officials accountable for their acts.It should be noted that the study of presidential misconduct—as a broad subject of inquiry, not in the form of studies of individual instances of it—remains neglected in comparison with other aspects of presidential history.  In his introduction to the published version of the 1974 report, Woodward termed that account unprecedented in its focus.  That characterization can fairly be applied to the subject still.  But is it accurate to assume, as Woodward also did, that there occurred a significant break between the misconduct of the Nixon and earlier administrations?  The panel will address that issue as it relates to both the Nixon and (to date) the Trump presidencies.  Moreover, little effort has gone into comparisons between misconduct in elective presidential and parliamentary systems, autocracies, and dictatorships.  The panel will try to open this subject also for discussion and further thought.Given the crisis in American governance today, the panel is likely to attract a large audience of students and scholars.  It is also likely to prove attractive to members of the press in the nations capital.</p>","Historians And Presidential Misconduct"

Engaging with the recent turn toward racial capitalism as an analytic for understanding the Atlantic and American political-economic system, this panel explores the multiplicity of roles played by peoples of the African diaspora in histories of political economy. From an analysis of the role of enslaved womens reproductive labor in the emergence of capitalism to an examination of African Americans engagements with the politics of international development to a reconsideration of Third Worldism as a critique of racial capitalism, the papers on this panel all speak to the necessity of linking our histories of political economy and our histories of the African diaspora in the Americas.Mohammed Elnaiem connects the new histories of capitalism with Marxist-feminist texts from the 1970s to highlight the centrality of reproduction in the longue durée history of capitalism. Elnaiem argues that placing regimes of reproduction at the center of histories of capitalism and slavery can shed new light on longstanding debates about the emergence of capitalism. He further claims that such close attention to reproduction under slavery is necessary in order to thoroughly racialize histories of patriarchy and engender histories of slavery.Charisse Burden-Stelly and Sam Klug each examine linkages between Third Worldist and black internationalist advocacy and structural transformations in global political economy in the post-1945 period. Klug examines African Americans engagements with the politics of international development aid. From debates about U.S. foreign aid policy in the late 1940s to debates about the speed and scope of Ghanaian industrialization in the late 1950s, the possibility of colonized territories—especially those in Africa—gaining political sovereignty while remaining in a state of economic dependency loomed large in black internationalist politics. This anticipatory critique of neocolonialism influenced African Americans on both sides of the Cold War divide, supporting multiple, sometimes conflicting political projects in the sphere of development. Burden-Stelly, meanwhile, argues that Third Worldist movements against militarism, U.S. imperialism, and Cold War geopolitics should be understood as critiques of the particular formation of racial capitalism that arose during the Cold War period. She thus casts Third World internationalism as internal to the political economy of the period, calling into question interpretations of the turn to the Third World as an exogenous shock or foreign importation that distracted from other struggles for justice in the United States.</p>","Histories Of Political Economy And The African Diaspora"

Our panel looks at US-Mexico migration and meditates on how migrants remain entwined within their home polity, as their home government in Mexico launched attempts to keep them, use them and root them, and as migrants themselves sought to shape the conditions under which they would remain on home soil. Morales, Gutierrez, and Ibargüen guide us chronologically through three distinct episodes in the 20th century. First, Morales shows how, in the context of the mass repatriation drives spurred by the 1930s Great Depression, the Mexican government rhetorically welcomed Mexicans back home and how migrants responded to the embrace by claiming they would love the opportunity to reestablish themselves in Mexico, given the opportunity. Ibarguen moves into post-WWII era and shows how Mexico lashed out at the emergency war-time guest-worker initiative, known as the Bracero Program, because of the way migrants were maltreated by American employers, and made a policy turn towards instead promoting permanence, a turn that was supported and celebrated across Mexican civic society and embraced, as well, by some migrants. Finally, Gutierrez looks at the lived reality of deported Mexicans in the 1970s and 80s who were ostensibly welcomed by Mexico but, in practice, were directed through mandatory routes of repatriation to land in areas with serious need of labor. Together, the papers unearth the shifting blend of sentimentalism and opportunism that marked the politics of migration in 20th century Mexico and its implication for migrant lives. Also, by turning away from an exclusive focus on the U.S. end of the migratory circuit, it makes clear that Mexico&quot;s policy regarding out-migration was not one simply of a &quot;safety valve,&quot; in which migration was welcomed as a way of relieving internal pressures. Mexico brought forth its own strategies, incentives, punishments, and ingenuity to purpose and repurpose the migration.</p>","Homeward Bound: The Mexican State And Attempts To Root Migrants Back In Their Homeland, 1930–1990"

These visions pitted rehabilitation against incarceration, social uplift against policing, and self-help against communal care. By bringing these struggles over urban futures to life, these papers can help historians to understand how hope for the city was both a response to and an engine of national politics in the late-twentieth century.</p>","Hope And Struggle For The Inner City: Race, Crime, And Urban Revitalization In The Metropolis"

Their central doctrine of the Inner Light, which declared that all people were part of God, created a spiritual imperative to treat others with respect, dignity, and love, yet the world of the expanding British Empire centered not love but on violence, human exploitation, and profit. Quakers radical theology created a cultural gulf between the people they did business with and themselves. While this tension amounted to little overt persecution after the détente of the Restoration, and did not prevent their dominance of Pennsylvania and Rhode Island governments until the 1750s, during times of tension, or over issues of existential import, Quakers could find themselves bearing the brunt of extreme ire. Quakers were never completely accepted by their contemporaries. The papers in this panel interrogate the ways in which Quakers dealt with these tensions in the context of the development of two important Quaker ideals, pacifism and abolition. Both developing theological positions at times highlighted contradictions between theological ideas and reality. Quaker families had prospered--and thus helped gain enough political and financial power within the Anglo world to protect their sect from further governmental prosecution--partly through participation in the slave trade, where some had made large fortunes. They had also prospered as the Assembly leaders of colonial Pennsylvania, where at times had at least implicitly sanctioned military action. Partially because of this outsiders-on-the-inside position, the Society of Friends developed a unique identity that continued to evolve in the development of their practices. They developed unique methods of conversation and decision making that enabled them to live in the world in ways quite different from their neighbors. Their meetings became mechanisms of ideological evolution and they developed unique institutions of mutual aid unlike anything else seen in the Atlantic world. From mutual aid, to pacifism, to slavery; Quaker relationship with their world and each other evolved in ways their contemporaries found alternately strange, admirable, and threatening.</p>","In The World But Not Of It: Quakers, War, And Slavery In The Early Modern Anglo-Atlantic World"

In the early 20th century growing numbers of Jewish applicants to elite universities sparked discussion of the value of cultural pluralism. But by the 1920s there were sharp restrictions on who could be admitted.  Some 70 percent of private colleges – and many state universities – limited the numbers of undesirable applicants, often among them African-Americans, Jews, Catholics and Asians. The goal was to maintain a majority of white Protestant, usually male, students. Panelists will discuss early concepts of diversity, the development of a quota system, and the resistance against it, including the founding of Roosevelt and Brandeis Universities, the Crack the Quotas movement, and the Fair Educational Practices Act. Civil rights legislation in the 1960s ended racial and religious quotas and ushered in the era of affirmative action, meant to increase the admission of students from groups previously excluded or underrepresented on college campuses. Panelists will look at subsequent legal battles over race-based admissions programs, the ideology of diversity management, and protests by Asian and white applicants.  David Weinfeld will discuss early 20th century ideas of cultural pluralism in college admissions, focusing on Charles William Eliot and the Menorah Society at Harvard. Lynn Weiner will speak about Chicago area college racial and religious admissions quotas in the 1940s, and the subsequent founding of Roosevelt University as an experiment in democracy in 1945. Miyuki Kita will talk about Brandeis University and the organizational challenges to the quota system that emerged in the mid 20th century.

Greta de Jong describes how citizen volunteers who served on court-ordered parent and community councils that were set up to help implement school desegregation in Boston in the 1970s took on tasks, without pay, that school and city officials had abdicated or left unfunded. Jane Bergers paper examines the unpaid caretaking labor that was forced upon low-income and working-poor African American women in the wake of cuts to social services in the 1980s.

E.P. Thompson&quot;s iconic statement that class happens when some men, as a result of common experiences…, feel and articulate the identity of their interests as between themselves...&quot; has profoundly shaped the field of labor history. Yet global approaches to the history of working-class people, given the critical roles played by colonialism and imperialism, require a rethinking of our conceptual tool box. This address will argue for conceptualizing class as a field of power relations that shapes experiences even when common interests are not perceived.&nbsp; Similarly, confronting the crisis of labor in the contemporary university requires a broader understanding of class relationships. New approaches to conceptualizing class experience can suggest opportunities for building much-needed solidarities among tenure-track, contingent, and graduate workers.

Through a close examination of the Constitution, a case study of a Pennsylvanian borderland plantation, and an exploration into segregated judicial structures known as slave courts, our projects interrogate the various tactics used by individuals in power to define the state through the treatment of both enslaved and free black people. Furthermore, we interrogate the extent to which the evolution of legal understanding among Americans cannot be separated from understandings of race and slavery during this period.This panel, as a whole, analyzes the complex ways in which legal and racial inequalities intermingled with the institution of slavery often at both colonial and state levels. We examine Taneys decision in Dred Scott, the complex ways space and race intersected under slavery, and the compensation payments paid to owners of executed slaves to trace how law, slavery, and centralized authority interacted in the long eighteenth century to produce the infamous highly racialized and capitalistic institution of the nineteenth-century. Ultimately, the complex relationships between law, slavery, race, and the state reverberated in the national sphere and shaped concepts of equality and inequality in the new republic. Moving away from focusing solely on the usual dichotomy of freedom and enslavement, the panel seeks to understand why race and slavery became increasingly entrenched by the late eighteenth century at the same time that the nascent United States came into being, and the individual states, as well as the nation as a whole, attempted to consolidate state power. Through audience discussion, short paper presentations, as well as discussion led by Professor Christopher Tomlins, our panel collectively questions the role slavery played in centralizing authority, what made a state (or colonial power) in the eighteenth century, and argues for the importance of close reading for understanding the relationships among enslaved peoples, slaveowners, and law-making powers.</p>","Legalizing Race: State Building At The Intersections Of Slavery, Race, And Law In The Long Eighteenth Century"

We come together as history faculty who have used immersive historical role-playing games in our courses. In a Roundtable session, each panelist will present a short paper about his or her experience teaching with role-playing games in American and World History courses and the ways that they have engaged our students with two types of inequality:   1. the inequality of the past, and 2. the inequality of the American educational system, K-12 &amp; higher education. In keeping with the 2019 conference theme, we envision this panel as part of a critical discussion about inequality and the future of teaching history in American higher education. Some of us adopted this approach to move away from a traditional lecture class format; others because of the pressure to attract more students to history. We have all found that role-playing can deepen historical thinking by presenting concepts of contingency and agency in non-traditional ways, and we have all drawn from Reacting to the Past. First developed at Barnard College, Reacting to the Past is a pedagogy in which students take on roles in elaborate debates structured by important historical texts and contexts, but the goal of this panel is not to promote the specific approach that Reacting to the Past offers. Importantly, we take a critical stance on the ethical considerations of role-playing across social identities, particularly ethno-racial identities. While some roundtable participants will emphasize role-playing games capacity to foster empathetic reasoning and collaboration across viewpoints and identities, others will discuss the challenges they have faced deploying the pedagogy in socially and politically diverse classrooms. This roundtable will thus probe the possibilities and limitations of leveling the playing field through game-based learning.</p>","Leveling The Playing Field?

During this time period, the creation of national and imperial ethe influenced how individuals understood themselves and others as they negotiated the unequal landscapes they inhabited.Each paper in this panel addresses how individuals were altered by their imperial encounters during a period in which Cuba transitioned from Spanish colony, to U.S. overseas possession, to independent nation under the supervision of the United States. Common to all three papers are historical figures who shifted their loyalties between regional, national, or imperial groups, as they actively negotiated their identities and searched for equality in an unequal world. Understanding the nuances of these circumstances complicates the historiography of American-Spanish-Cuban relations and provides scholars with a more contextualized understanding of both how and why groups of individuals defined themselves during this complex period.The first paper by Gregg French analyzes how trans-imperial identities can be adapted to fit the imperial landscapes of the metropole and the periphery. French contends that despite being at war with the Spanish Empire in 1898, many U.S. military officers and colonial administrators disregarded their Cuban allies and developed a sense of comradery with their imperial counterparts; an act that had been previously facilitated by the use of the Spanish past as the foundation of the American historical identity in the metropole of the U.S. Empire. The second paper by Lisa Jarvinen explores how Cuban General Calixto Garcías loyalties were frequently questioned and tested as Cubas status as a sovereign nation was being decided. Ultimately, Jarvinen argues that national loyalties were impossible commitments to maintain when placed in a fluid imperial context. The final paper by Michael Neagle explores the experiences of U.S. citizens who lived on Cubas Isle of Pines in the decades following the Spanish-American War. Initially, these citizens rejected local cultures and claimed superiority over the native pineros. However, by the middle portion of the twentieth century, Americans on the island had redefined their identities and had formed bonds with their fellow islanders, which contrasted with the diplomatic tensions between the two countries following the Cuban Revolution. Collectively, the panel presents how a diverse range of individuals continuously adapted to their surroundings as they attempted to define their loyalties and identities during a period of imperial flux in Cuba. Often lost in the turbulent era between the Spanish-American War and the Cuban Revolution, these papers focus on the lives of individuals who were in search of a level of sameness with those who surrounded them. David Sartorius will serve as chair and provide commentary on the panel.</p>","Loyalties And Identities In Unequal Imperial Landscapes: American-Spanish-Cuban Relations, C. 1890s–1950s"

Many of the most compelling and rich sources are hidden away in the personal papers of African Americans across the country who have never been approached or made aware of the historical value these documents possess. Most U.S. repositories, libraries, archives, and historical societies are already severely underrepresented with regards to their African American collections and holdings. Society as a whole is rapidly becoming a visual culture, and an archive like The <i>HistoryMakers Digital Archive</i> is committed to being the digital repository for African Americans in the digital age. Given that less than 1% of the over 3,000 accomplished and noteworthy African Americans that we have interviewed have plans for their papers, and that more than 2,000 of the interviewees are age 70 and above, the identification, preservation, documentation, and accessibility of these papers and collections is an absolute imperative not only for ensuring a more complete and accurate record of American history, but also for the future of scholarship in a myriad of academic disciplines. <i>The HistoryMakers</i> has already assembled the nations – and the worlds – largest repository of 20th century African American oral testimony, but without the support and collaboration of scholars across the globe to surround this collection with the contextual and documentary evidence necessary to provide a better picture of the history these testimonies allude to, all of our understanding of the past and the future will be hampered.

Its purpose is to advance the NPS education mission through the development of scholarship and programming in the public humanities. Three postdoctoral scholars joined the NPS in September 2018 for a two-year term. Their work will be concentrated in three thematic areas: the Legacy of the Civil Rights Movement, Gender and Sexuality Equality, and the History of Labor and Productivity. A primary aim of the fellowship is to link NPS staff and partners working in history-related positions with scholars inside and outside academia conducting cutting-edge research in a variety of temporal and thematic fields. The Mellon program builds on many of the important findings highlighted in the 2011 Organization of American Historians publication Imperiled Promise: The State of History in the National Park Service. The report identified better connection with the rest of the history profession as one of the key actions necessary to ensure that the NPS remained relevant and responsive to the changing needs of diverse publics. This roundtable is an opportunity for scholars to learn about history programs in the NPS and to share their ideas, experiences, and perspectives on working with the agency. It also presents a chance to reflect on the recommendations of Imperiled Promise. In the years since its publication, the NPS has continued to facilitate conversations about the reports findings and strategized ways to address its call for a robust and well-supported cadre of historians. But have these efforts been effective in changing the practice of history within the agency? What obstacles remain most intractable and where has progress been made? Can historians working outside the agency in a variety of settings be part of achieving the goals identified in Imperiled Promise?Based on experiences working within and with the NPS, roundtable participants will comment on innovative projects, including digital initiatives, which transcend the capacity issues discussed in the report&quot;s findings. They will also share examples of programs where more resources are still needed. Mellon Fellow Mia Carey will emphasize her work as the acting NPS Civil War to Civil Rights National Coordinator and as the Mellon Fellow in the Legacy of the Civil Rights Movement. Mellon Fellow Sylvea Hollis will address intersectional approaches to interpreting gender &amp; sexuality at NPS sites.

Currently, as an institution, the U.S. military is struggling with a massive and intractable epidemic of sexual assault; it is whipsawed between (externally mandated) requirements to allow and then to ban transgendered servicemembers; it is analyzing the (again, externally-mandated) end of Dont Ask, Dont Tell (DADT); it is attempting to deal with the impact of extended war on servicemembers families, and it is beginning to allow women to serve in the combat arms. Each of these is a critical issue to the military, but also ties to ongoing questions about sex, gender, and sexuality in American society and to broader issues of civil-military relations. These contemporary issues tie to a longer history within the military and to a broader historical context.This panel brings together three historians to offer different perspectives on the broad question: How has the U.S. military attempted to manage sex? In answering this question, the panel will demonstrate how the social construction of sexuality and gender has shifted in keeping with broader changes in American society, even as prior definitions (buttressed by institutional culture) continue to shape contemporary policies and debates. Prof. Worsencrofts paper will examine the ways the military utilized families to bolster its public image and meet personnel needs in the wake of the beginnings of the All-Volunteer Force. As the armed services realized that family men offered greater stability and committed fewer transgressions than single men, they enacted policies encouraging or supporting marriage and allowed married—and pregnant—women to serve. Prof. Wilson-Buford will examine the militarys beleaguered attempts to manage sexual violence, while drawing connections between policies and related assumptions about soldier masculinity, sexuality, race, and gender. These policies and assumptions tell us much about the ways the U.S. military has attempted to manage sex within the ranks and between servicemembers and peoples of other nations. Prof. Hamner will bring our discussion to the present-day, where discussions about the opening of combat roles illustrate persistent questions about the ways the military regulates gender and sexuality. His paper will examine the ways various groups—including military commanders, officers, and enlisted personnel, as well as the public—have responded to these developments. Despite the far-reaching significance of the militarys policies on sex and sexual identity, scholars have not come together to analyze such policies or their unintended consequences and lasting implications. This panel argues that such understandings are critical to the military, as it searches for solutions to address complex policy issues that at their core involve intractable issues related to sex, gender, and sexuality in the contemporary United States and its recent past. Such understandings are also critical to the history of the United States, for military policies regarding sex both reflect and affect not only larger social and cultural patterns but help to shape individual experience and national policies as well. </p>","Managing Sex In The U.S. Military"

It also examines how Mexican officials created and reinforced inequalities in their relationships with Mexican migrant communities. Panelists push the geographical boundaries of Mexican immigration history by focusing on locales outside of the Southwest, offering perspectives that complicate both scholarly understandings of Mexican consulates and the Mexican migrant experience in the United States. Juan Mora explores the failures of the Detroit Mexican consulate to protect braceros and the migrant-created networks that secured consulate assistance from Texas during World War II and after. Mora highlights the employer-structured inequalities of Michigan&quot;s agricultural fields and the strategies migratory workers developed to improve their working and living conditions in the state. Carolina Ortega examines the underlying class inequalities that emerged during the formation of the Mexican colonia in New York City during the 1920s. Ortega reveals transnational networks of migrant-families communications as well as Mexican officials who smoothed over the reverberations of the Cristero War. Moreover, her study demonstrates how class inequality defined the relationship between the Mexican consulate and the New York community, with working-class Mexicans celebrating Mexican Independence Day separately and being subjected to repatriation at a higher rate than their professional compatriots. Bryan Winston explains how the Mexican consulates of St. Louis and Kansas City functioned as a carceral corridor, simultaneously freeing imprisoned Mexicans and facilitating their repatriation. Winston illuminates how Mexican migrants challenged their disproportionate arrest rate and struggled to define the terms of repatriation through correspondence with Mexicans state officials. Commentary from Gabriela Arredondo promises to illuminate the unique contributions of the panel because of her familiarity with Mexican consulates and the Mexican migrant experience in the United States. Arredondo will push panelists and the audience to consider the implications of these studies and how the panel can spark novel inquiries into Mexican consulates in the United States. Overall, the panel expands scholarly interpretations of Mexican consulates and encourages others to do the same.</p>","Mexican Consulates And The Negotiation Of Inequality In The Twentieth-Century United States"

Jenkins (University of Chicago); Dr. Sean Harris Vanatta (Princeton University)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2020-04-04</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 10:00 to 11:30</h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Presentation</h5></p><p>This session aims to challenge scholarly understanding of the timing and process of financialization—defined broadly as the movement of financial services to the center of the U.S. economy and of financial logics to dominant roles in state policy and daily economic life. In the early postwar era, the reigning consensus suggests, the liberal New Deal state constrained the power of finance. Scholars document how these restraints unraveled in the 1970s—with economic restructuring, persistent inflation, and the decline of the Bretton Woods International Monetary System—and follow financial acceleration with federal deregulation and the ascendance of modern conservatism in the 1980s. Finance eclipsed waning postwar liberalism in this telling; or, to use a darker metaphor, finance nailed up liberalisms coffin. The papers on this panel challenge this consensus. Collectively, they argue that financial executives, financial markets, and financial logics decisively shaped three essential projects of postwar liberalism: home ownership, public education, and secure retirement. We see this not by looking at federal policy, where the consensus has focused, but instead by turning to states and municipalities, which remained dependent on private capital to support their public ambitions. Local dependence on private capital granted financial elites leverage over the ambitions of the welfare state. In short, finance had been in the drivers seat all along, albeit discreetly. In her paper, Land, Capital, and Segregated Suburbs, Paige Glotzer puts the role of private capital in shaping public policy in long perspective, demonstrating how transnational investment networks engineered segregated suburbs before and during the New Deal. The suburban dream of property-ownership and rising home values was thus founded on monetizing whiteness long before these impulses were inscribed in federal housing policy. In addition to racial control, postwar Americans were drawn to the suburbs for the promise of good schools, but that promise too materialized only through financial markets. As Michael Glass argues in his paper, Borrowing to Build, school construction in the 1950s and 1960s relied on bond markets that were expensive, uncertain, and difficult for amateur school boards to navigate. One reason for this dependence was the unravelling of local investment support from state pension systems in the early 1950s. In, Splitting the Atom of State Finance, Sean Vanatta traces how the New York State Public Employee Pension System completely divested of local securities beginning in the late 1950s, instead betting the security of its retirees in corporate securities markets. In sum, by looking at the state and local level, we find that finance exerted deep, structuring influence over the ambitions of postwar liberalism, encouraging scholars to rethink the origins, mechanics, and consequences of financialization.</p>","Midcentury Markets And The Public Reliance On Private Capital"

They received Congressional approval to build a $130 million, 40,000-square-foot, subterranean museum adjacent to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial. Originally imagined as a site for Vietnam War history, the Education Centers mandate slowly shifted from historical interpretation of the Vietnam War to memorialization of the Vietnam dead. With the nations attention turned towards the Middle East in the 2000s, the Education Centers focus also broadened to include recognition of military service in Iraq, Afghanistan, and future wars as well. Eighteen years and $23 million in expenditures later, and just days after a journalist broke the story that Fund insiders doubted the project would ever be built despite fundraising pleas to the contrary, Fund Chair John Dibble announced the projects demise. As he explained to the Washington Post, Since the idea was developed in early 2001, the world is a very different place. This Roundtable proposes to ask what changed and why. More specifically, we will take Dibbles suggestion that the Education Center failed due to cultural changes as a serious invitation to examine recent transformations in war memory, patriotism, and the meaning of military service. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial offered a bold, modernist interpretation of the war memorial that critics found maddeningly opaque on the ethics and politics of the war, fundamentally transforming not just the National Mall but American memorial practice writ large. In contrast, designs and fundraising appeals for the proposed Education Center at The Wall framed the Vietnam War as a necessary, even just, conflict and its American dead as heroic, willing participants. Does the failure of the Education Center represent the failure of this re-interpretation of the Vietnam War? Or have Americans so fully embraced Vietnam as a noble cause that the war memorials on the National Mall can carry nationalistic, triumphalist narratives forward, leaving no need for a museum to make them explicit? Has the mission of militarizing the National Mall indeed been accomplished? How does the fraught history of the Education Center at The Wall reflect recent transformations in American ideas about war and soldiering that in turn reflect cultural anxieties about protecting and promoting a heroic, white, masculinist military? What can we learn from a failed campaign to build a museum about a lost war?

Fletcher (Albright College); Dr. Sarah Lirley McCune (Columbia College); Dr. Lynn Rainville (Washington and Lee University); Ms. Jamie Warren (Borough of Manhattan Community College, City University of New York)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2020-04-02</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 14:30 to 16:00</h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Presentation</h5></p><p>Inequalities not only shaped the lived experiences of Americans during the nineteenth century, but it also impacted their deaths.  Three presentations drawing from coroners inquests, burial records, and writings of social scientists reveal that various lives were measured in similar unequal terms.  Jamie Warren examines inequalities that were present in ideas about death, particularly white Southerners racist ideas about African American mortality.  Warrens paper will examine the intellectual history of the &quot;black disappearance hypothesis,&quot; a theory that emerged among late nineteenth-century social scientists and statisticians who claimed that recently freed African Americans were on the path toward extinction. While most scholarship situates the black disappearance hypothesis in the context of Gilded Age professionalization, the rise of statistical knowledge and methodologies, and Progressive Era racist reform, Warrens paper will analyze this concept in the broader intellectual traditions of the slave-holding elite. While this theory was clearly rooted strongly in white supremacist naturalist traditions, she will demonstrate how such intellectual traditions were uniquely shaped by the supra-nationalist political visions produced by white southern Planters. Decades before racial mortality rates were used to bolster social Darwinist claims about black inferiority, whiles elites of the antebellum South used death and morbidity as means to articulate their racial ideologies and philosophy of history.  Inequalities also shaped burial practices, as Lynn Rainville will demonstrate.  Rainville analyzes the material and archival clues that reveal the location of poor farm cemeteries in Virginia.  For over two centuries, Virginian counties sponsored workhouses or town farms that housed a wide range of dependent people. The goal was to provide room and board for individuals who were deemed socially or morally unworthy by their peers. Most of these facilities were closed by World War II; today, most of these sites lie in ruin. But the attendant graveyards are usually discoverable. In this paper, Rainville analyzes the material and archival clues that reveal the location of poor farm cemeteries. And she concludes with an analysis of the grave markers and mortuary rituals that were used in the last rites and final resting places of the poor and the inmates of this public institution.  The final paper examines the ways in which inequalities shaped death investigations.  Sarah Lirley McCune argues that race, class, gender, and character shaped investigations into and prosecutions of alleged homicides in late-nineteenth-century St. Louis.  Drawing on coroners records, newspaper accounts, and court records, Lirley McCunes essay will examine how inequalities impacted coroners inquests as well as prosecutions, convictions, and sentences.  Unsurprisingly, black men and women often faced harsher sentences and were tried more quickly than their white counterparts, which is especially evident in cases of domestic violence.  The press celebrated these convictions, often using racist language and stereotypes.  Domestic violence cases also reveal gender inequalities, as some women (those with questionable reputations) were blamed for their own murders, at least by the St. Louis press.  While these papers rely on diverse sources, they share similar findings.  Southerners lives were valued differently in legal systems, social practices, and scientific discourse.</p>","Mortal Measurements: Appraising The Value Of The Dead In The Nineteenth-Century South"

The Great Depression and the rise of dictatorships in Europe challenged American culture and politics to regain its footing in an age defined by fear. This panel focuses on the decade that preceded the federal governments international deployment of culture by exploring milieus and genres on the cusp of becoming part of American global engagement. As part of a Faustian bargain that preserved racial segregation to build a new national state (Ira Katznelson), New Deal programs such as the Federal Music Project (FMP) documented and recognized distinct American musical traditions. The FMP recorded and documented folk songs including black spirituals, hillbilly songs, and Native American music. Vaudeville and minstrel shows had given rise to jazz. The New Deal invigorated a discourse about cultural nationalism among composers of classical music and created opportunities for new roles of music in society. By contrasting three genres prominent in the 1930s (folk, jazz, and classical music), the panel addresses distinct American musical traditions just before each would move onto the larger stage provided by the music industry and radio as well as the national and international uses of music during World War II and the Cold War.</p>","Music In Times Of Political Crisis: Jazz, Folk, And Classical Music In 1930s America"

As Kent State and Jackson State prepare for their 50th commemorations, it is important to consider why events with so many similarities are remembered so differently and to better understand the efforts of the individuals trying to preserve this difficult history.  The conversation will cover many pressing issues, including memory and history, the intersection(s) of race in society and culture, the role of media, and the importance of the First Amendment.On May 4, 1970, members of the Ohio National Guard killed four students and wounded nine others in what is often called the Day the War Came Home.  Some of the casualties were protesters, others were bystanders, and even more were left with unseen, but deeply felt emotional wounds.  That night, the event headlined all four networks and the next day, was featured in nearly every major newspaper.  Richard Nixon called May 4, 1970, the darkest day in my presidency.There were far fewer headlines two years prior when nine State Highway patrol opened fire on more than 100 students gathered at South Carolina State to protest the police brutality and the arrests of students attempting to desegregate a local bowling alley. Three students were killed.  The story was much the same ten days after the Kent State shootings two young men, one a young father and the other a high school track star, were killed by State Troopers at Jackson State, a historically black college.  While there are substantial differences in the events, in all three cases the students were unarmed and the shootings similarly indiscriminate. In fact, Jackson State was far more violent.  Ohio Guardsmen shot 67 bullets in 13 seconds at Kent State, while Mississippi Highway Patrolmen fired 150 rounds for 28 seconds, striking their targets, most often with buckshot, more than 400 times.  At South Carolina State, most of the 27 injured students were shot in the back as they fled.  In his pivotal work, Shadowed Ground: Americas Landscapes of Violence and Tragedy, geographer Kenneth E. Foote describes four categories under which most historic sites typically fall:  sanctification, designation, rectification and obliteration. Sanctified sites are the most highly valued and preserved. They represent historic sites where the societal lessons are considered so important, they must never be forgotten. Designated are closely related to sanctified sites, but they lack the heroic or sacrificial qualities. Rectified sites may be briefly notorious, but they are quickly restored to working order and the events forgotten or overlooked.  Finally, obliterated sites are reserved for the most challenging events in history, where the memory is so painful that the site is altered to make it unrecognizable.  Kent State, Jackson State, and South Carolina State represent the breadth of these categories. This roundtable will explore why.</p>","Never Forget: Memorialization And Commemoration At Orangeburg, Kent State, And Jackson State"

The panel highlights the diverse geographies of Mexican and Mexican American religious experiences in the 20th century, from Chicago, rural towns of California, and the scattered communities that faced the states heavy hand of repatriation and deportation. Repatriation, indeed, mostly uprooted those in urban centers such as Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles but historians maintain that virtually every Mexican-born family would have had to confront the decision to leave. While Barba and Elmores papers explore the uprooting of Mexicans in an era of the immigration regime (1924-1965), Kanters paper demonstrates the experiences of a community firmly planted in a neighborhood only to have the doors of the church (quite literally) closed on them in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.The papers demonstrate how the use of religious and nonreligious sources in historical research capture the diverse experiences of those often left out of the archival record. Elmore uses federal archives and religious sources to show how civil rights activists leveraged religious institutional resources to resist repatriation, while Barba relies on oral histories and photographs to gather reflections of the past. Kanter pulls together institutional archives and oral histories to offer both bottom-up and top-down perspectives on the closing of churches. Together, these three papers add new insights into the history of migration, politics, and Latina/o religion in the 20th century United States.Our panel also raises questions about the role of religious communities and resources in Latina/o life in the US: In what ways do non-archival sources and religious sources provide new insights about the experiences of those on the margins of the historical record? How have different communities negotiated uprootedness? The panel is chaired by Julia Young (Catholic University of America), whose recent scholarship highlights the crucial role of transnationalism in Mexican communities in the early twentieth century. The panel does not include a formal comment. Instead, the panelists hope to generate a collaborative conversation with the audience about the use of fugitive sources and traditional archival sources read against the grain as a way of addressing inequalities in contemporary and historical discussions on inclusion, migration, and community building. </p>","New Directions In Latina/O History: Using Religious History To Overcome Inequalities Of The Historical Record"

The papers demonstrate that the imperialism promoted by the National Park Service takes many forms. A closer look at inclusionary community advancement projects highlights the often hidden colonialist agenda of the National Park Service.Helis Sikk critiques the National Park Services recent interest in LGBTQ landmarks and pasts as a homonationalist attempt to catch up with the post-1960s cultural history and foster inclusion. Sherri Sheus paper examines the professionalization of law enforcement in the NPS in the 1970s, which occurred as part of Richard Nixons broader law and order policies.

How can scholars attend to the erasures that shape how black womens stories are told in the historical narrative? What is the analytical potential gained when definitions of archives expand to include not just  traditional repositories but bodies, performances and domiciles? How do the power dynamics of being a subject v. an object in the historical record shape the memory of black womens narratives of survival and resistance? How have the institutional imperatives of assembling archival collection shaped black womens ability  to have a say over how they are remembered in the historiography? Interrogating the traditional and self-fashioned archive, these papers excavate black womens interiority, especially their everyday and longstanding concerns across historical time periods. In the face of the brutalities of sexual exploitation, the restrictions of heteronormativity, and rampant anti-communism, these black women struggled to define freedom for themselves and their communities through radical political organizing, cultural expression, and self-determination.   Raising important questions about black womens experiences--during enslavement, the end of the Progressive Era, and within twentieth century social movements-- these papers help us better understand the histories of black families in the North, queer history, and the black radical tradition.  </p>","New Perspectives On The Archival Recovery Of Black Women's History"

We propose a roundtable featuring several of the contributors to this special issue, chaired by Crystal Feimster. The existing history of the woman suffrage movement has focused primarily on white womens participation through mainstream suffrage organizations. The JGAPE special issue expands this limited history with new research focusing on race, science, and sex, illuminating a vast number of previously untold suffrage stories and complicating the stories we thought we did know.  Understanding that demands for womens suffrage took place during a moment of fraught citizenship, Rachel Gunter analyzes how claims for woman voting worked in the larger context of debates about non-citizen voting and the disfranchisement of servicemen. Similarly, Kimberly Hamlins study of Congressional documents and correspondence between the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) Congressional Committee and key members of Congress reveals the extent to which the 19th Amendment was discussed in terms of the 15th. Not only did Congressmen resist the idea of black women voting, they also feared that ratification of the 19th Amendment would prompt the 15th to be enforced. Twentieth century political history has recently witnessed an outpouring of scholarship on the conservative movement and on conservative women. This JGAPE issue expands this line of inquiry into the 1920s. Sunu Kodumthara reveals how anti-suffrage women reluctantly transitioned into voters in the 1920s, often in order to counteract the influence that they feared other voting women would have.In addition to de-centering the experiences of white suffragists, the research in this JGAPE special issue expands our understanding of suffrage history by foregrounding debates about woman voting in new contexts. In her article Inventing Citizens, Kara Swanson mines the ways in which white suffragists and African Americans applied for – and then publicized—patents as an alternative way to make claims for citizenship, incorporating the history of technology into womens rights history. Drawing on insights from the history of medicine and sexual history, Heather Prescott explores the previously understudied links between the suffrage and birth control movements, highlighting the women, such as Crystal Eastman and Katherine Dexter McCormick, who were involved in both reforms. In this OAH roundtable, each contributor will preview their research for 3-5 minutes and suggest questions to facilitate broader conversations about how historians might approach the upcoming centennial in their classrooms, research, and public events. While acknowledging 1920 as an important moment, this roundtable will also destabilize it, emphasizing that for women of color, continuity reigned rather than change and stressing new questions that we might ask about race, sex, science, and womens political participation. </p>","New Research On Women's Suffrage At The Centennial"

This panel draws our attention to the unequal distribution of risk and opportunity during the Cold War. The promise of national security was paid for by Indigenous Pacific Islanders supposedly under the protection of the United States, by various groups of neglected uranium miners recovering the raw fuel for warheads, and by minority communities who suffered reduced access to government resources which instead funded the production of nuclear weapons. How marginalized populations came to terms with the costs they bore in the name of U.S. national security engendered conversations regarding the states public health obligations, the viability of new political coalitions based on race and organized labor, and the legal legitimacy of claims against the U.S. government. Reflecting the composite approaches that characterize the field of nuclear history, the papers offered in this panel present a cradle to grave analysis of nuclear weapons. Tracking the effects of extraction, testing, and production done through an examination of social movements, an emphasis on environmental factors, and through legal analysis demonstrates how nuclear weapons created an essential shared lived experience for Americans and non-Americans in the 20th century. This shared experience tapped into broader developments in U.S. history; specifically, the bureaucratic growth of the national security state, the development of environmental consciousness and management of the natural world, and the persistent and problematic state of race-relations in American politics and society. Our panels exploration of these themes is rooted in a spatial conception of the Cold War. Office buildings in Washington D.C. and palaces in Moscow, the front lines in Europe, or peripheral conflicts in the developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin and South America have consumed the attention of scholars of the global Cold War. We bring attention to the overlooked costs of the Cold War to various geographies of the United States: urban, underground, and extraterritorial. Our findings indicate that nuclear weapons are a pervasive agent of historical change in U.S. history, producing at the same time both the perception of national security vis-a-vis the Soviet Union and the reality of national insecurity within the spaces that Americans lived. </p>","Nuclear Inequalities In The American Century"

How have historians defined mobility and is this definition sufficient? Does our historical understanding of race change if we examine it from the perspective of a seafaring vessel rather than the static vantage point of a colonial settlement, city, or nation-state? How did racial or ethnic classifications intersect with other categories of identification—e.g. class, gender, or health status—to shape ones migratory experience in the Pacific? What opportunities (real or imagined) did migrating to and through the Pacific afford to historically racialized Others given the overwhelming constraints that empire presented?In an effort to answer such questions, this panel draws on an array of sources—from travel narratives and theatrical productions to steamship company records, medical reports, and government correspondence. Embodied by Steerage: Asian Migrants, Steamship Travelers, and the Spatial Construction of Transpacific Mobility, presented by Seoul National University Research Fellow Minyong Lee, explores the physical layout, usage, and cultural representation of Asiatic Steerage cabins aboard American-owned transpacific steamships. In so doing, her paper contends that a steamships spatial layout not only determined how Chinese migrants experienced transpacific voyages, but also shaped the American cultural conceptualization of Pacific crossings. Fit to Float?: Race, Health, and Mobility in the American Pacific, presented by University of Chicago doctoral candidate Christopher Kindell, charts the medical microhistories of two late-nineteenth-century steamships transporting Chinese and Portuguese migrants to Hawaii. His paper suggests that investigating racialized medical encounters aboard transpacific vessels can provide scholars with an alternative lens through which to examine the medical epistemology of public health. Whereas the first two papers focus on the physical movement of seafaring vessels, the third paper—Imagining a Black Pacific: Empire, Culture, and the Birth of Afrofuturism, presented by Auburn University Assistant Professor Guy Emerson Mount—investigates how fictional renderings of a Black Pacific during the age of Jim Crow enabled prominent Black communities to envision the Pacific as a region where racial oppression might be elided. While theatrical performances illuminated broader concerns over the types of racial ideologies that were possible in a Black Pacific, the circulation of these ideas were also instrumental in shaping the ways in which Black Americans tangibly engaged with the Pacific World. Katherine Benton-Cohen, Professor of History at Georgetown University, will serve as chair and commenter for the panel.</p>","Pacific (Im)Mobilities: Conceptualizing Race, Transportation, And Empire In The Late Nineteenth And Early Twentieth Centuries"

Restrictions on access to law enforcement records, even those that are supposedly available through public records laws, limit scholars avenues for understanding the policing of movements. Meanwhile, contemporary media mistakenly portray Black Lives Matter as a new civil rights movement and treat the FBIs focus on Black Identity Extremists as evidence of newly frayed relations between activists and law enforcement. This panel, by contrast, will discuss how these developments are nothing new, as we explore activist efforts to curtail police power and law enforcement surveillance from the early twentieth century onward. Our panel investigates a variety of ways in which law enforcement agencies sought to understand and undermine social movements, including through public hearings, postwar demobilization legislation, police publications, and the surveillance of women activists long thought to be overlooked by COINTELPRO. Indeed, as our panel shows, a much longer history of surveillance and social control endured by black and brown communities prefigures todays tactics for policing movements. Shannon Kings paper will explore New York City Mayor Fiorella LaGuardias 1935 commission on that years riots in Harlem as a political battleground where citizens, police, and organizations such as the Communist Party and the NAACP all confronted each other. Out of the commissions hearings emerged calls to end the police occupation of Harlem as well as a nascent social justice movement—comprised of black nationalists, liberals, and the black left—against anti-black violence in New York. Using difficult-to-find sources in policing professional literature, Stuart Schraders paper will examine how the GI Bill and post-World War II demobilization sought to enhance repressive capacities of the state and close off avenues for veterans to express political discontent and participate in social movements. A largescale effort to channel thousands of veterans into law enforcement careers was designed effectively as a means of controlling labor organizing and anti-racist activism. Joshua Daviss paper explores the discourse about civil rights activism found in law enforcement publications. This paper scrutinizes the language police used to describe the movement, identifying aspects of the movement police described as permissible and others they described as criminal. In so doing, Daviss paper reveals how police developed a both sides analysis that wrongly treated the civil rights movement and white supremacist groups such as the White Citizens Council as ideological adversaries who nonetheless practiced equivalent forms of disorderly, extremist politics.Finally, Ashley Farmers paper identifies gender-specific tactics the FBI used to attack black women radicals from the 1950s to the 1970s and examines how these women combatted surveillance. Her paper reinserts black women into histories of surveillance and imprisonment and challenges long-held ideas that CONTELPRO was focused overwhelmingly on men, offering valuable insight into how we might think about the Bureaus contemporary efforts to track and undermine black communities.</p>","Policing Social Movements In The Twentieth Century"

While James Davison Hunters 1991 volume Culture Wars, long the dominant interpretation of the phenomenon, argued that the conflict was simply a battle between evangelical Protestants and secular Americans, more recent scholars of the period have embraced a more nuanced analysis.  Books by Andrew Hartman (A War for the Soul of America), Daniel Rodgers (Age of Fracture), David Sehat, and Robert O. Self, among many others, have reinterpreted the culture wars as a conflict between multiple competing visions of America – visions that differed over not only religion but ideology, politics, media, behavior, and family life.  In fact, many aspects of the culture wars were more complex and less binary than they appeared in earlier interpretations – and nowhere was this complexity more obvious than in the battles over popular music in the 1980s and 1990s.This panel argues not only that popular music was central to the cultural debates of the last fifty years, but that approaching the culture wars through the interpretive lens of music recasts conflict in important new ways.  The four papers presented here return again and again to two overlapping themes: the centrality of race to cultural debates over popular music, and the complexity of the conservative response to cultural change within the musical realm.  Indigenous people in post-1967 Detroit, explains Kyle T. Mays, drew on the musical languages of Hip Hop culture to demonstrate solidarity with Black revolutionaries and to advance their own cause of radical resistance.  Meanwhile, in Chicago and other Midwestern cities, according to Brian M. Ingrassia, Italian-American arena rock band Styx articulated their own incipient whiteness by modernizing racist concepts such as the Great White Hope for Reagan-era audiences.  The 1985 Parents Music Resource Center crusade against heavy metal music, argues Chelsea Watts, revealed not only the tensions within the conservative response to cultural change but also the strange connections between the politics of heavy metal performers and those of their conservative antagonists.  And the enduring popularity of Lee Greenwoods 1984 conservative anthem God Bless the U.S.A., opines Jeremy C. Young, shows that a broad desire for unity persisted throughout the age of fracture – and that the divide between dreaming of unity and celebrating diversity was at its heart a racial one.Taken together, the papers on this panel embrace the multifaceted nature of the culture wars by drawing fresh conclusions from a series of late-twentieth-century musical debates that animated the complexities of the age.  Randall J. Stephens, whose The Devils Music: How Christians Inspired, Condemned, and Embraced Rock n Roll (2018) is one of the most important books to consider the role of music in the modern American cultural divide, will chair the panel and offer a concluding comment.</p>","Popular Music And The Culture Wars"

The concept of intimate labor has been critical to exploring the gendered dimensions of global capitalism and domestic production. Historian Eileen Boris and sociologist Rhacel Salazar Parreñas define intimate labor as the work of forging, sustaining, nurturing, maintaining, and managing interpersonal ties, as well as the work of tending to the sexual, bodily, health, hygiene, and care needs of individuals.  Boris and Parreñas note much of this type of work historically had been performed as behind-the-scenes labor of women and the poor and that it became defined as unproductive of exchange value. In other words, it fell under the concept of reproductive labor.  Yet, over the course of the last two centuries, this same work has been increasingly commodified, though these forms of commercial intimacy are often still performed by women, people of color, and/or migrants. This panel seeks to demonstrate the ways that the analytic of intimate labor can illuminate disparate forms of commercial intimacy by examining how the markets of affect, care, reproduction, and sex intersect with the politics of migration and (un)freedom. Though this panel is grounded in case studies drawn from US history, the work presented here seeks to highlight the global connections that have structured the development of the market of intimate labor and commercial intimacy.Drawing from notarial and court records from antebellum Louisiana, Dr. Noel Voltz investigates the affective labor performed by free women of color at New Orleans infamous Quadroon Balls to explore the accumulation of social, racial, and economic capital by women who leveraged their intimate labor. Shifting from the affective to the domestic, Professor Eileen Boris examines how migrant domestic workers coming to the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s occupied a twilight zone between freedom and unfreedom. Her work challenges the periodization of free labor and of labor trafficking. In Supplying Care, PhD candidate Justine Modica shows how the au pair program developed by the State Department in 1985 developed a transnational market of child care providers from abroad by constructing a multi-tiered and racialized system of transnational migration. Dr. Ji-Yeon Yuh turns our attention from child care to marital migrants who offered a set of wifely labors. US immigration policy singled out Asian women as potential prostitutes in 1875, and since then, Asian women have frequently entered the US as brides. By connecting the picture bride to the war bride to the military bride, Dr. Yuh illuminates the centrality of intimate labor to Asian womens exclusion, marriage, and migration.</p>","Producing Intimate Labors: Domesticity, Inequality, And Racial Capitalism"

As George Lipsitz has argued in his seminal work How Racism Takes Place, we must acknowledge the great degree to which this countrys literal terrain has been constructed by the white spatial imaginary, and take stock in the modes through which the black spatial imaginary attempts to resist these racializing practices in the face of inequality. Our panel builds on this conceptualization by taking Washington D.C. as the physical space in which we examine this dynamic of resistance and community formation being played out by various minoritized and racialized populations that have come to inhabit the area. That is to say, our panel asks, what political and socioeconomic (in)equalities emerge when we consider the relationship between racial formation and place in the nations capital for marginalized subjects of the U.S. nation-state? And, more poignantly, how are these larger racializing dynamics and fractures interrogated and resisted among those that they affect?By interrogating systems of marginalization through African American and Asian American narratives, our panel seeks to understand how place is instrumentalized by these groups in order to survive and at times resist their racial and national oppression. And by bridging the many racialized populations inhabiting the larger Washington D.C. area, these papers together engage in histories of uncovering through the juxtaposition of national, institutional, and local archives. Patrick Chung uses the 1976 Koreagate Scandal to explore the impact of Cold War geopolitics on the lived experiences of Korean American immigrants in the D.C. metro area—specifically, his paper contrasts the reception and regulation of Korean Americans who either supported or denounced the U.S.-backed military dictatorship in South Korea. Andrew Friedman examines CLR Jamess time at Federal City College, and how the intellectual space of the university and the city contributed to his engagement with notions of decolonization and black feminism. Ida Yalzadeh takes the two spaces of LaFayette Park and Bethesda, Maryland as springboards from which to understand the fractures in Iranian diasporic movements of resistance and racialization in the years after the Iranian Revolution and Hostage Crisis. Ultimately, these papers engage with (in)equality emergent from the relationship between race and space while also gesturing to the larger modes of transnational engagement of these historical actors by virtue of their paths of migration</p>","Race And Place: Thinking Through Immigrant (In)Equalities In 1970s Washington, D.c."

It will also consider how sports history can be effectively incorporated into history courses and museums in ways that encourage students and visitors to explore key historical questions in greater depth.Because sports are so all-encompassing—engaging body, mind, and spirit—and because they have been so closely associated with American political and cultural institutions, they offer an especially promising arena for exploration and interdisciplinary work. Unsurprisingly, the field of sports history has blossomed in recent decades. Studies of African Americans in sports have been especially thought-provoking, illuminating questions not only of race, but of gender, class, community and nation. This roundtable brings together scholars whose work covers more than two centuries of African American athletes on racetracks, baseball diamonds, football fields, tennis courts and other fields of play, exploring themes that include the move from slavery to freedom, the dynamics of black female labor, and the thorny political and cultural issues raised by school desegregation. They will share insights from that work, with a particular focus on how their findings reinforce, challenge or expand broader historical narratives. The panel will also explore ways that sports history can be used draw audiences – whether students, readers, or museum visitors – into important historical discussions. Panelists will discuss the successes and frustrations they have encountered while using sports to address issues of race and equality in a variety of university and museum settings. This is important work. In an era of declining numbers in history classes and history majors, highlighting the history of sports has the potential to spark student interest. But it is also challenging – while some students are eager to examine sports in greater depth, others are quite reluctant to critique the games and institutions that mean so much to them. There is a lot to talk about. If the committee chooses to accept this proposal, we promise a fascinating discussion. </p>","Race In Sports History; Race In American History"

Xu shows how Gilded Age lawyers, Chinese immigrants, and African American Civil War veterans leveraged legal actors and state officials skepticism about legal advocacy for racial(ized) minorities in their efforts to challenge the racial status quo in legal challenges against the federal government. Funk examines the role that African American lawyers played in reforming Maryland state law in order to secure Black enfranchisement, prevent lynchings, and portray African Americans as legitimate political actors at the turn of the twentieth century. Taparata explores how Native Americans and African Americans used the Works Progress Administrations Federal Writers Project to recollect their family members experiences as refugees during the Civil War, challenging emerging legal definitions of refugee that prioritized individuals crossing international borders and obscured refugee passages within US borders. Together, the papers on this panel apply comparative and critical race/ethnic studies approaches to several areas in the study of laws relationship with society, including lawyering and the legal profession; access to meaningful legal representation; the relationship of law to governance, surveillance, and state building; and the formation of legal categories and the ways that everyday Americans relate to and contest them.</p>","Race, Law, And Authority In The Gilded Age And Progressive Era United States"

In the 1930s and 1940s, National Parks in Virginia began to desegregate their facilities ahead of local custom.  In the 1950s and early 1960s, the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission chaired by Laurance S Rockefeller identified large racial disparities in access to public lands and recreation, prompting NPS to create  new National Recreation Areas and Historical Parks in urban areas, as well as to establish the Land and Water Conservation fund.

Scholars have identified the connective tissue also between race and religion in American history, and have devoted considerable time and energy to show the connection between the rise of the Religious Right in the aftermath of the civil rights movement. However, few works recognize the multiple nodes of contact between race, inequality and the religious ideas that affirmed the power of white religion and the state in the American century.This panel seeks to illuminate the multitudes of ways that religion and religious peoples have shaped inequality in all its forms and responses to it. Lerone Martin examines how ministers, both Black and white, worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to thwart the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Exploring the careers of men he calls Bureau Clergymen, Martin explains how the ministers elevated status within their communities, their media savvy, and their anticommunist politics created a cohort of influential anti-civil rights crusaders. In doing so, both the FBI and their Bureau Clergymen supported a form of white Protestant Christianity, manifesting in a civil religion opposed to social justice. Alison Collis Greene analyzes interracial work camps for youth sponsored by the Fellowship of Southern Churchmen in the 1940s. She argues that these work camps fostered relationship across lines of race, class, and ethnicity. However, the Fellowships work of Christian community building proved inadequate to its goals of confronting and eradicating the inequalities endemic to the Souths white supremacist economic system. Angela Tarango investigates San Antonio Texass La Trinidad United Methodist Church, the largest Latino Methodist congregation in the 1950s United States. In doing so, she articulates how La Trinidad successfully led to its congregants&quot; attainment of white middle-class Protestant respectability and accompanying securing of political power and influence. Her ethnographic research suggests that La Trinidad accomplished this while embracing its Mexican-American roots and Tejano culture. Through her study, Tarango argues that Methodism functioned as a tool to combat economic and racial inequality for Latino Protestants living in a majority Latino Catholic city controlled by a small group of white elites in Cold War America. Joseph Stuart considers how the Nation of Islam created a new, religio-racial form of masculinity during the Great Depression that celebrated Black Men. After World War II, the Nation of Islam reframed their teachings regarding what made an ideal Black Man to reach the rising number of incarcerated Black men. In doing so, Stuart analyzes how the Nation of Islams religious message also worked as a rallying call to Black men that gave them meaning in the face of emasculating circumstances before and after World War II. Through these papers, these scholars highlight the importance of religion in creating and maintaining social, economic, gendered, and political power in the twentieth-century United States.</p>","Race, Religion, And Inequality In The Twentieth-Century United States"

We pay attention to the processes through which negative sets of characteristics have been attached to groups of people both wittingly and unwittingly, by those who see themselves as enemies and allies of people of color. Christian Paiz analyzes the ways in which Filipino farmworkers have been erased out of the history of the United Farm Workers movement, even as the movement has been championed as a pivotal moment within the Chicano/Latinx movement. Cecilia Marquez considers the political potentials and limitations of the term Juan Crow within immigrant justice movements. Although the term suggests Black-Brown solidarity, it inadvertently erases the historical and contemporary presence of Afro-Latino/as and denies the persistence of black oppression in the South. Sonia Lee critiques the therapeutic culture created by community psychiatrists in the 1950s and 60s. Community psychiatrists sought to include poor patients of color within the field of mental health by highlighting the extra layers of mental suffering they had to endure under racism and capitalism. Despite their attempt to understand black and Latino patients political subjugation, however, they ended up focusing on black and Hispanic culture as the locus of healing, and unwittingly reinforced their racialization. In these various contexts, the presenters find that campaigns for racial egalitarianism often faced the prospects of re-inscribing racial inequality and inadvertently participating in the marginalization of racialized communities.</p>","Racial Formations Within Social Movements: Forging Solidarities And Complicities"

Abreu (Northern Illinois University);  The Audience (); Professor Ernesto Chávez (University of Texas at El Paso); Ms. Shirley Jennifer Lim (Stony Brook University, State University of New York); Professor Anthony Mora (University of Michigan)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2020-04-02</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 11:00 to 12:30</h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Presentation</h5></p><p>Historians have longed mined media as valuable sources for understanding discursive ideas about race, gender, and sexuality.  This panel continues that work by digging deeply into specific images and creators of Asian American and Latinx representations in Hollywood.  We know well the range of stereotypical representations each of these groups suffered in the early twentieth century as duplicitous seductresses, hapless buffoons, or cold-blooded killers. Each of these papers, however, uncovers a particular instance when the stability of such stereotypes became threatened. Rather than promoting a simple formula for advocating racial/gender/sexual equality, all three figures enacted changed racialization through which the scope of possibilities both expanded and contracted. Media producers had to reconcile those challenges against their political and social context.  Shirley Lim recounts an illuminating encounter between Chinese American actress Anna May Wong and German-Jewish philosopher Walter Benjamin in 1928.  In an article spurred by the encounter, Benjamin exposed his inability to reconcile his assumptions about Wongs persona as a Chinese American film star with her lived cosmopolitanism and embrace of European sensibilities.  Lim argues that the same incongruities that confounded Benjamin actually lay at the center of Wongs successful global career.  Wong defied the narrow Orientalist roles available in Hollywood and escaped the racist restrictions imposed by Californias legal system through the newly emerging pan-European cinema.  Ernesto Chávez takes up another silent star, Ramón Novarro, who likewise challenged Hollywoods common representation of Mexicans as simple laborers and/or cruel criminals.  Like Wong, Novarro found his options severely limited after a decade playing Latin Lover roles.  In 1936 he wrote and directed the Spanish-language film _Contra La Corriente_ as a counterpoint.  The film centered on a romance between an elite Mexican American woman and a working-class Argentine swimmer.  Novarro therefore pushed against Hollywoods portrayals of the Latinx community as racially and economically monolithic.  The film also marked a new phase in Novarros career where he began accepting almost only Latinx roles.  Yet, the film held limits placed on the star.  The films fantasy of a heterosexual romance hid his own same-sex desires, not to mention his ongoing affair with the films male lead. Anthony Mora concludes the panel by considering how the character Zorro unexpectedly became a source of anxiety at the height of his popularity.  Disneys television program _Zorro_ (1957-1959) proved a hit almost immediately.  Like most versions of the titular character, the show initially presented him as a vigilante fighting to end government oppression in colonial Los Angeles.  As the real-life civil rights movement heated up in the 1950s, however, conservative producers at Disney seemingly became uncertain about having a Latinx character advocating for civil disobedience on a weekly basis. Over the course of the series, they therefore remade the character into a defender of law and order.  In a jarring switch, Zorro ultimately began advocating for the mestizos and Native peoples who surrounded him to have faith in government institutions.  Taken together, these papers show powerful interventions in racialized representations and the forces which muted their impact.</p>","Racial Rogues Of Hollywood: Challenges To Latinx And Asian American Inequalities In Early Twentieth-Century Media"

The tragic and tumultuous events of that spring have provided indelible, iconic images: strikers with I Am a Man placards, King delivering his Mountaintop address, and the Life magazine photo of the gravely wounded leader on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel.  But while the assassination and the strike rightly loom large over the citys history, they have rendered the later years virtually invisible. The Memphis of 1968 is familiar to all; the Memphis after 1968 is relatively unknown.     This session foregrounds developments in Memphis in the years immediately after 1968, making the city central to the scholarly conversation rather than incidental to it. Memphiss long, tangled history of racial discrimination, socio-economic inequities, and white repression did not suddenly end in 1968. But in subsequent years, more so than ever before, black and white students, activists, and citizens became increasingly assertive in challenging the white supremacist system, a challenge that inspired a backlash from the powers who ran the city.      Each paper in this session illuminates an element of the citys post-1968 history.  Shirletta J. Kinchen considers the emergence of the youth-driven Black Power Movement in Memphis starting in the late 1960s and demonstrates the key role Stax Records played in the Movements growth and development. As Memphis-based Stax emerged nationally as the musical soundtrack to the Black Power Movement, black youth in Memphis looking to establish their own political platform engaged traditional and non-traditional modes of Black Power activism in their struggle for freedom. Gregg L. Michel examines the Memphis Police Departments efforts after 1968 to suppress activist causes of all types, from civil rights to opposition to the Vietnam War. Working through a secret counterintelligence unit—a Red Squad—the police illegally spied on, harassed, and abused activists until the unit was exposed and disbanded in the mid-1970s. Michael K. Honey assesses the complex realities of post-1968 Memphis, a time in which movements for social change led by African Americans, women, and labor unions endured and even expanded. Their achievements, however, came against a backdrop of deindustrialization and a rising tide of conservative political power that have called into question the gains of the civil rights era and highlight the work still needed to achieve the freedom and equality envisioned by Martin Luther King Jr.      Collectively, the sessions papers demonstrate that a vibrant, multi-facted movement for social change continued in Memphis well after the strike and assassination. The persistence and resilience of these movements stand as a corrective to interpretations that suggest leftists movements collapsed or simply faded away after 1968. And they highlight the rich, frequently overlooked history of post-1968 Memphis in which advocates of reform and change fought to achieve their vision of a freer, more equitable society while enduring attacks and repression from the citys entrenched powers. </p>","Racism, Repression, And The Freedom Struggle: Memphis After 1968"

In doing, the panel shatters various siloes built around Chicanx political activity in the post-movement era by arguing that there is no post- but rather a living, albeit new, extension of the movement that empowered women to demand their place in the Democratic Party and facilitated interracial coalition building in the 1980s.&nbsp;</p>","Radicalism, Reform, And The Terrain Of A New Chicanx Political History"

But the resurgence of nativism and xenophobia beginning in the 1990s, culminating with the election of President Donald Trump, has prompted a re-consideration of the 1965 Immigration Act.

Participants decided to emancipate themselves from burdens placed on women of color at their respective institutions by engaging in liberatory acts of stealing away each week to write with each other.  The group has met either physically or via electronic mediums each Friday for three years. The resulting community not only produced award-winning scholarly work and grant proposals, but also promoted self-care, peer to peer mentoring, and accountability. The collective is a by-product of a 2012 writing partnership, which expanded in 2015 and became a ten-member working group by 2017. This working group serves as a model for how women and people of color can create safe spaces to develop, share, and model successful writing strategies beyond their academic institutions. Each participant will share strategies of success and the experimental steps that allowed them to address the institutional and structural inequalities that once hindered their productivity.  Workshop attendees will be guided on the steps to forming a virtual and physical writing group as well as on the process of having their institutions support the effort with both monetary and physical resources.</p>","Reclaiming Our Time When There Is None: Navigating Inequalities To Publish And Flourish In The Academy"

González, a former activist turned journalist, weaved narrative and historical research together answer why Latinos come to the United States. González pointed to U.S. intervention in Latin America as the cause of immigration. This text is a staple reading for Introduction to Latino History and Introduction to Latino Studies on campuses nationwide. This panel brings together professors from research-intensive universities, a community college, and a small liberal arts college along with Juan González himself to reflect on the significance of this work. 20 years ago, Juan Gonzálezs Harvest of Empire changed the way Latino history was taught and conceptualized. This text, by former Young Lords Party activist turned journalist in the present, was published after decades of anti-Latino immigration backlash during the 1980s and 1990s. From attempts to make English the official language to forcing people to report undocumented immigrants under penalty of law, there seemed to be little empathy for immigrants from Latin America. With the publication of Harvest of Empire, there was a succinct yet thorough explanation of why Latinos come to the United States. In plain language, González pointed to U.S. intervention in Latin America as the cause of immigration in a book that had mass appeal. Harvest of Empires largest contribution comes in the way it was written and the choice of content. Gonzálezs thesis was not new. Latin Americans themselves and scholars of Latinos, Latin America diaspora, and immigration, among others, had long pointed to U.S. intervention as the cause of instability in the region and emigration. However, Harvest of Empire was written with a different audience in mind. González who is now a named professor at Rutgers University wrote this when he was a journalist for the New York Daily News and a co-host of Democracy Now. He was clearly well versed in writing for a larger group of people than many for which many academic texts are designed. Thus this text combined riveting narratives about intervention in a style it seemed only a journalist could write with sound historical research. González also picked up on trends that shaped the discipline of Latino history. As a relatively new field with its inception during the 1960s social movements, the majority of monographs in the field looked at one Latino ethnic group to the exclusion of others. There was a wealth of information on Mexicans or Puerto Ricans, for example, but there had not been many texts that put the experiences of various Latino ethnic groups into conversation with one another. Moreover, González published information about Guatemalan and Dominican immigration to the United States well before there were a large number of historical monographs on these people. The discipline of Latino history has become much more pan-ethnic since the 2000s and Harvest of Empire was a part of that shift. </p>","Reflecting On The 20th Anniversary Of The Publication Of <I>Harvest Of Empire</I> By Juan González"

Baysa (Princeton University); Mr. Andrew Klumpp (Southern Methodist University); Ms. Elise Leal (Whitworth University); Dr. David Mislin (Temple University)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2020-04-04</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 10:00 to 11:30</h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Presentation</h5></p><p>This panel brings together a diverse group of emerging scholars in the field of intellectual history toexplore the intersection of religion, national and international networks, and the history of ideas inthe long nineteenth century. In particular, this discussion examines how the study of national andinternational intellectual networks illumines how ideas shaped nineteenth-century politics, religion,and culture. For instance, robust intellectual networks helped to refine conceptions of Americanexceptionalism, to legitimize global imperialism, and even to transform Socialist communities intoquasi-religious establishments. Collectively, these presentations demonstrate the complex ways thatindividuals from a variety of backgrounds engaged with significant intellectual movements and howthey used their understandings of religion to interpret and operationalize ideas in broader nationaland global contexts.Baysa begins with a study of nineteenth-century conceptions of American exceptionalism. He rootshis study in the eighteenth century before moving forward to explore how liberal religious traditionsand international networks influenced understandings of American exceptionalism, with particularemphases on industrialization and war. In each of the intellectual contexts explored by Baysa,international networks reinforced, challenged, and transformed understandings of Americanexceptionalism, particularly when facilitated by liberal religious traditions.Klumpp examines understandings of imperialism within a group of rural Protestant immigrantcommunities during the latter half of the nineteenth century. These men and women drew onunderstandings of empire that were informed by thinkers in both Europe and North America, andthey used religion to justify their own imperial expansion. They heralded an imperialism thatemphasized missionaries, teachers, and physicians yet also aimed to expand economic and politicaldominance throughout the globe. Transatlantic intellectual networks provided an imperialisticparadigm and their religion justified an ambitious plan of expansion.Drake concludes the panel with her study of Socialism among working class men and women in theUnited States. In particular, she explores how the Socialist Party of America utilized a multifacetednational network to fashion itself as a replacement for traditional religious institutions. She focuseson how working-class citizens received information about the movement and applied the ideaspresented within it in a way that placed them at odds with religion. By doing so, Drake demonstrateshow Socialism managed not only to adopt the trappings of a religious movement but also toposition itself in opposition to more traditional expressions of religion.Within each of these papers, religion and intellectual networks intersect to inform how men andwomen interpreted and operationalized ideas in the nineteenth century. For some, this meantrefining definitions of American exceptionalism within international contexts or embracing globalimperialism under the banner of Christian evangelization. Yet, for others, it involved creatingmeaningful communal organizations located outside of traditional religious organizations. Americanexceptionalism, global imperialism, and the Socialist movement represent three powerful ideas thatshaped the nineteenth century, and together these papers demonstrate how religion and carefullycultivated intellectual networks informed how men and women interpreted and acted upon theseinfluential nineteenth-century ideas.</p>","Religion And The Influence Of Intellectual Networks: Interpretation And Operationalization Of Ideas In The Nineteenth Century"

This is due to Nurembergs groundbreaking and controversial legacy. Nuremberg has influenced our understanding of international law, transitional justice, human rights, and Americas place in the world. It even laid the foundation for the current International Criminal Court (ICC), a permanent version of Nuremberg designed to prosecute individuals suspected of the worst atrocities imaginable. Nuremberg set a precedent in 1945 by holding individuals accountable for war crimes. Never again would heads of state be allowed to escape prosecution. The rule of law would reign supreme over force and tyranny. It was also an international effort, made up of American, British, French, and Soviet prosecutors and judges. This was no show trial, as all of the German defendants received counsel, the prosecution presented documentary evidence and called witnesses to the stand, the judges deliberated regularly, and the Trial lasted for nearly a year in order to ensure due process. Three of the defendants were even found not guilty. Most observers consider Nuremberg a success. Many Nazis and German leaders faced punishment, thereby warning future lawbreakers of what would await them if they committed similar crimes.However, Nuremberg has always been controversial. The charge of crimes against humanity, which essentially referred to the Holocaust, had never existed before in international law, and critics denounced it as ex post facto law. Also, only the Allies sat in judgment over the defendants, and they were guilty of committing similar war crimes, which raised questions about the Trials fairness and objectivity. Additionally, Nurembergs promise of bringing future war criminals to justice fell flat during the Cold War, and it was not until the early 1990s that similar courts sprang up to prosecute crimes in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. It took nearly 60 years before the ICC came into force, and its efficacy and stability remain in question since both the U.S. and Russia are not members.On the 75th anniversary of Nuremberg, it is time for scholars in history and law to reevaluate the Trials legacy. Elizabeth Borgwardt examines Nuremberg from a human rights perspective, and her current project traces the origins of the concept crimes against humanity. Francine Hirsch focuses on Nuremberg from the Soviet Unions perspective, and her latest book examines the politics of Nuremberg, Cold War competition, and the making of the postwar order. John Q.

This panel analyzes this legacy, with an eye to making more intelligible the sanctuary movements of today. It brings together scholars working on contemporary migration in a historical context, as well as one historian currently employed as a refugee advocate for an NGO. Rachel Ida Buffs paper searches the practice of nineteenth century sanctuary movement activists as well as internationalist strategies in response to the displaced persons crisis of the mid-twentieth century for the antecedents of todays migrant sanctuary mobilizations.  As Yael Schacher and Carl Lindskoog discuss in their papers, the foreign born have had diverse allies with different ideological commitments and goals.   Lindskoog and David Hernandezs papers also make clear that there has been a dialectical relationship between state repression and sanctuary activism and that one important function of past and present activism on behalf of migrants and asylum seekers has been to draw attention to the causes of their displacement.  Each of these histories reminds us that sovereign states have long claimed the right to determine who can enter their territory and what the nature of freedom will be for those who reside within their borders.  But these papers also illustrate some of the many ways that individuals and groups (sometimes in the form of movements) have sought to defend vulnerable people, be they fugitive slaves, migrants, foreign-born students, refugees, or asylum seekers.  The roots of todays struggle between Sanctuary Movement activists and the U.S. government run deep and they are part of a much longer history of freedom movements, in the United States and beyond.</p>","Sanctuary: Defending The Vulnerable And Challenging The State From The Nineteenth Century Until The Present"

In addition to connoting sinless perfection and complete goodness, purity has served as an aim and justification for systems of white supremacy and heterosexual patriarchy. Both racial and sexual purity rely on the notion that something (e.g. whiteness, chastity) requires vigilant protection against imminent threats. The meanings of purity have shifted over time, and historical actors have variously reinforced, reframed, and resisted these different purity discourses.This panel traces how American religious groups developed different meanings and uses for the notion of sexual purity in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Because purity is both a racialized and sexualized concept, this panel demonstrates the intersections between race and sex within religious rhetoric and practices. The panel puts into dialogue three presentations that examine the role of purity in religious discourse, community practices, and activism. Samira Mehta analyzes how liberal Protestant clergy marshalled a definition of purity for marital sex to justify contraception for married couples in the decades after World War II. Mehta tracks how liberal Protestants rejected earlier eugenics justifications for contraception and instead argued that married couples had a purity of intent when they expressed sexual love and decided whether and when to produce children. She illustrates how these notions of pure responsible parenthood furthered the idea of familial privacy from state power while also reinforcing middle- and upper-class white norms.Hannah Waits outlines the global work of evangelical missionaries during the AIDS crisis. Waits shows how missionaries altered US evangelicals views about the AIDS epidemic, and how missionaries used resources from the US purity movement to spread abstinence-only education programs throughout the Global South in the 1980s-2000s. She demonstrates that missionaries shifted evangelicals understanding of AIDS by reframing the epidemic within the racial othering of mission work, thereby rousing white evangelicals sympathy for and desire to save black and brown suffering bodies across the world. Kera Street explores the digital and in-person practices of black Protestant women in a national womens group called Pinky Promise, and she reveals how these women utilized purity as a governing principle for their daily practices and embodiments of piety. Street traces the ways that digital media platforms and face-to-face chapter meetings facilitated members shared efforts to discipline their hearts, minds, bodies, and desires to align with what members believed that God required of them. She demonstrates how these practices constructed a broad notion of purity that functioned as a set of everyday commitments, motivations, and behaviors that shaped individuals religious identities, online and offline.Together, these presentations point to the ways that actors and groups have engaged purity discourses both to challenge and reinforce social hierarchies. By examining how conceptions of sex and race have functioned within contraception campaigns, global AIDS programs, and womens online communities, this panel expands our understanding of how the notion of purity has been a powerful tool for white and black religious communities over the last century.</p>","Sexual Healing?

These relationships were complex and difficult to navigate, but they reveal multidimensional layers of political expression, legal action, and strategic maneuvering. New approaches to legal records, account books, and financial records have helped historians uncover the scope of these relations and their significance.This panel seeks to highlight three current attempts to better understand the relationship networks of enslaved individuals in the antebellum United States. The first, &quot;The Black Family and the Archive during Slavery&quot;s Waning Days in the Pennsylvania Interior&quot; by Cory Young (Georgetown University) seeks to highlight the sources used by the historians and genealogists attempting to retrace the networks of African-American families in the Pennsylvania interior. The unique realities of gradual emancipation have left a long paper trail for scholars to follow as they reconstruct family connections through the maternal line. Second, Patrick Hoehne (University of Nebraska) uses a GIS-centered approach to map the spatial, legal, and personal relationships embedded in the 1822 and 1834 Washington D.C. city directories. His piece, In the Shadow of the Capital: Slavery, Violence, and the Law in Early Washington D.C. explains the methodology for connecting legal and spatial data and explores the utility of spatially-grounded approaches to investigations of enslavement, violence, and the legal system. Finally, Sharon Leon (Michigan State University) will present Individual Stories, Larger Understandings: Digital Representation of the Enslaved Community Owned and Sold by the Maryland Province Jesuits. This piece explores the community and family networks of enslaved individuals held by the Maryland Jesuits. The project explores the relationships built and maintained across Jesuit owned farms before 1838, with a focus on individuality, community, and experiences. The panel will be chaired by William G. Thomas III (University of Nebraska), who has an extensive background in studying the relationships of enslaved individuals through his work on freedom petitions and early Washington D.C.

Within each of these movements, questions about who was included extended across lines of gender, race, class, and educational status. Presenters will reflect on how reformers negotiated between different types of authority—moral, religious, cultural, or philosophical—to make their claims about equality. These papers chart the course reformers took to understand what equality meant to them and explore who was excluded from key social reforms during the Progressive era and how Progressives understood such exclusion. Laura Ping (Queens College) will examine how nineteenth-century dress reformers believed that clothing was key to understanding gender inequalities; yet they failed to understand the inequalities within their own movement, which did not appeal to working class and African-American women. Serenity Sutherland (SUNY Oswego) will present on MIT chemist Ellen Swallow Richardss career at MIT (beginning in 1870 and continuing to her death in 1911) as the first female student and then as the first female instructor. Through starting a Womens Laboratory and serving unofficially as the womens dean of students, Richards created a space for women at MIT, yet womens education was not truly equal in comparison with how men were accepted to MIT and treated as students. Jessica Derleth (SUNY Binghamton) will present on how the woman suffrage movement capitalized on the cultural authority vested in gender norms by portraying themselves as good women who would bring morality and order to the public realm. In this quest for equality, suffragists positioned themselves in opposition to bad women—a thinly veiled reference to prostitutes and black women—and reassured the American public that these women would remain politically weak or even disenfranchised.Each paper deals with key moments in womens and gender history where women fought for equality with men, but failed to address additional inequalities in American society related to class and race. By exploring cases related to dress reform, education, and suffrage, each of the panelists consider how Progressive era reform agendas were primarily directed at middle-class white women, how the exclusion of poor women and women of color shaped the broad womens rights movement of this era and how these specific movements for equality reinforced and laid bare other forms of inequality.  </p>","Social Movements And Progressive Inequalities, 1850–1930"

Railway gauges, currency agreements, and screw thread angles do not inspire the same fascination among readers as wars and revolutions do. Yet they are arguably just as powerful as shapers of history. Standards lubricate trade within a zone of compatibility, whether that zone be spatial, conceptual, or economic. This panel is dedicated to mapping those zones. In so doing, it seeks to draw attention to a hidden dimension of power. Standards, though less visible and certainly less flashy than politics, operate on a fundamental and intimate level, creating a world where some forms of interchange are easy and others are impossible.  Stephen Mihm uses industrial standards to challenge the familiar narrative about Fordism. At the same time as Henry Ford and other corporate leaders pursued vertical integration, other less-known economic actors sought to standardize parts. Their legacy, of dispersed economic production and long-distance supply chains, is the one were living with today. Liat Spiro explores the connection between standards and international power, using civil engineering and finance to understand how the United States sought to leave its mark on Latin America and Asia in the early twentieth century. Finally, Daniel Immerwahr offers a history of globalization from the perspective of material culture, pointing out the important physical transformations required to sustain todays world of effortlessly long-distance markets.

More recently, scholarship from Mark Krasovic, William Corson, Annelise Orleck, Kenneith OReilly, Robyn Spencer, Alan Altshuler and others have opened lines of inquiry into local urban police departments and red squads, welfare departments, military intelligence, and the longer history of the FBIs assault on Black freedom efforts. Not just FBI director J. Edgar Hoover but also red squads, welfare bureaucrats, beat cops, and elected officials all brought the full and often violent weight of the state to bear upon every dimension of the Black Revolt.This panel sees itself in concert with this growing body of scholarship. Now that the state, in various guises, is widely understood to have played a pivotal role in the suppression of Black Power and related movements, scholars must turn their attention to the localized dimensions of state suppression and connect the dots across local, state and national borders. The four papers of this panel will interrogate the dimensions of state repression in the Black Power era, while the chair and commentator will make those connections. Burgins paper takes a long view of Judge George Crockett, Jr.s experiences by connecting the repression he experienced as a defense lawyer during the first Smith Act trial to the states interference in his bids for public office in the 1960s. As a student-activist and Newark native Komozi Woodard studied the contest between Black liberation and several counter-revolutionary strategies; he will reflect on these experiences which he sees as essential to understanding the history of the Black Revolt. Levys paper examines the death of Ralph Featherstone, the SNCC leader who was killed by a car bomb on March 9, 1970, in Bel Air, Maryland, where H. Rap Browns trial for inciting a riot had been moved and was scheduled to begin the following day.   Though government officials immediately claimed that Featherstone and his compatriot, William Payne, had blown themselves up, a wide array of activists contended he had been assassinated and charged local, state, and federal officials, with covering up the truth.  Hills paper explores the repression of the Nation of Islam chapter in Rochester, NY, part of a broader campaign of repression launched by local authorities against black activists.  All told, by attending to localized efforts, these papers speak to many of the strategies that historians have discovered were central to state repression – including infiltration, violence and surveillance. However, they also insist on a plethora of other strategies that included developing cozy relationships with media outlets and conservative groups, the disruption of democratic processes inside and out of the US, and crossing nation-state borders to do all of the above. </p>","State Repression In The Black Power Era"

Speaking directly to the theme of (In)Equalities, this session brings eyewitnesses to the shootings and their aftermaths together with scholars to explore the continuities and differences between these two events, with particular focus on the role of race. The shootings seemingly have much in common. At Kent State, the Ohio National Guard opened fire killing four students and wounding nine. At Jackson State the Mississippi Highway and Safety Patrol and Jackson police killed two young people and wounded twelve. The violence produced a sense of community among the victims, and other Americans were also quick to draw similarities.  As one journalist suggested, the shootings at Jackson State were simply Kent State II.  Such a view, though, often missed the deep differences in context and cause. At Kent State, where a radical and sometimes biracial movement had been gaining momentum throughout the 1960s, veteran antiwar activists were already familiar with the exercise of brute force by uniformed authorities, though few, if any, imagined that they would be fired upon on a school day afternoon. The vast majority of less involved students were shocked and incredulous that the National Guardsmen even loaded their weapons, much less utilized them. Alternatively, the Jackson State shootings were another chapter in the ongoing story of state violence against African Americans.  Jackson State had long been under state control, and was a relatively inactive campus as a result.  By 1970, though, the institution reflected the impacts of civil rights and Black Power activism, posing a new threat to white supremacy. Many members of the Jackson State community continue to believe the shootings were a pre-meditated attack on their campus.  What is clear is that the assault on a crowd that had not been protesting, let alone rioting, was motivated by racial animus and a sense of white impunity. Later, as victims from both campuses fought for justice, their experiences continued to reflect the shared impact of state violence and disparate realities produced by racial difference. For those attentive to the past, the shootings at Kent State are generally well remembered, a touchstone whenever the era is revisited. In contrast, the killings at Jackson State quickly receded from the nations public memory, the victim of the conflation of the two events. As the son of one of the Jackson State fatalities lamented, If I try to tell people about the shootings at Jackson State, they don&quot;t know about it. They don&quot;t know until I say &quot;Kent State.&quot; For us to even be acknowledged, it had to happen at Kent State first.&quot;  Recently Americans have been forced to confront ongoing state violence even as the rhetorics of law and order and of white supremacy are again employed in public speech. This session illuminates divergent curves in the long arc of state violence, providing for new understandings and new actions.</p>","State Violence And The Problem Of Race: The Shootings At Kent State And Jackson State 50 Years After"

This panel will bring together scholars of war and American society, including Professor Sherry, to discuss how the lessons of In the Shadow of War might be applied to the contemporary United States—and how the book might be expanded to encompass the twenty-five years since its publication.<i> In the Shadow of War</i>&nbsp;endures because, unlike so many surveys, it makes an argument: America since the 1930s has been molded by militarization, which Sherry defines as the process by which war and national security became consuming anxieties and provided the memories, models, and metaphors that shaped broad areas of national life. As Sherrys definition suggests, <i>In the Shadow of War </i>is concerned with more than political institutions. It also deals with the social and cultural ramifications of militarization—the political culture of a nation made and re-made by war. This is a book which is equally comfortable analyzing the speeches of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the science fiction of Kurt Vonnegut. The books signal contribution is to locate the roots of militarization not in the Cold War but in the 1930s, the moment when the United States began to slip into a twilight zone of neither war nor peace. Sherry demonstrates how the 1930s witnessed the emergence of myths which would sustain the process of militarization: the myth that warfare generated prosperity, for instance, and that war united and disciplined society. And while militarization underwent numerous crises in the decades which followed, <i>In the Shadow of War</i> demonstrates that war nonetheless held a tenacious grip on American politics, culture, and society.&nbsp; <i>In the Shadow of War</i> concludes with a chapter titled A Farewell to Militarization? Our panel will take this question as its starting point. How has the meaning of war changed in the decades between 1995 and 2020? Did the American response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 mark a new era of militarization or did it simply continue older trends? How, in the post-Cold War world, do Americans understand foreign threats? And what influence does the shadow of war have on the new cultural battlefronts which have opened at home? To answer these questions, this panel will assemble some of the leading historians of the modern United States. In addition to Professor Sherry, currently the Richard W.

Many historical narratives about the northern plains recognize them as a crucial zone of interaction and conflict in the seventeenth through end of the nineteenth centuries. In the past decade however, historians have taken a renewed interest in this region and its importance to the history of the North American continent in more recent times. Historians have specifically emphasized the continued presence of Native peoples and their centrality to the culture, economics, and politics of the modern northern plains, combining their histories with scholarly subfields and methodologies such as urban history, public history, and the history of religion.This panel highlights the presence and importance of Native actors to the regions history during the twentieth century. As Americans colonized the northern plains, they enforced a settler colonial social and political regime that dispossessed Native Americans of their land and sacred spaces, built cities and towns, and substantially altered the regions ecology. The papers presented here emphasize both the history of settler colonialism and inequality in the region, as well as the ways in which Indigenous people resisted the homogenizing efforts of American society and adapted to changing circumstances; in short, how they remade and retained Indian Country on the northern plains. Native people adopted new religions, maintained their older ceremonies and material cultures, and remained constantly in motion during the twentieth century. This panel showcases the newest scholarship on the northern plains region of North America and in doing so, makes the argument that the northern plains are a central part of the story of race, settler colonialism, religion, and Indigenous resistance in the modern American West.  </p>","Still Indian Country: The Indigenous Northern Plains In The Twentieth Century"

From debates over how African Americans should respond to the successful redress movement for Japanese Americans to questions of how black history and racial violence should be remembered and represented in major memory sites, the papers on the panel all consider the strategic politics of redress and remembrance. Jun Abe (Tohoku University) explores African Americans attitudes towards the Japanese American redress movement of the 1980s. While Japanese Americans sought the support of other racial groups in their successful bid for reparations for WWII internment, African Americans who had long sought reparations for themselves were ambivalent about what Japanese American redress meant for their own efforts, and whether the movement could be used to advance the black struggle. Akiko Ochiai (Doshisha University) suggests a larger framework for understanding the current state of Americas racial memory politics by contrasting approaches that focus on integration (or including black history more fully in American history) to those that seek to desegregate national memory by challenging and trying to reconcile the memory divide between blacks and whites about Americas racial history. Finally, Fumiko Sakashita (Ritsumeikan University) compares the memorialization of the lynching of Emmett Till at different commemorative sites in Mississippi to that of the Equal Justice Initiatives lynching monument and new museum in Alabama to showcase the diverse ways in which sometimes contradictory memories of the same event are negotiated on the landscape.&nbsp;</p>","Strategies Of Remembrance And Redress: The Evolution Of African American Memory Politics Since The 1980s"

Cartwright (Music History, particularly, Women in Music History); Professor Veronica Castillo-Muñoz (University of California, Santa Barbara); Dr. Nupur Chaudhuri (Texas Southern University); Dr. Bernadette Pruitt (Sam Houston State University)</i></h5><p><h5><b>Date:</b> 2020-04-02</h5></p><p><h5><b>Time:</b> 12:45 to 14:15</h5></p><p><h5><b>Type:</b> Paper Presentation</h5></p><p>Since its inception in 2006 by community activist Tamana Burke, the Me Too Movement has galvanized millions. Inspired by this crusade for gender equity and the eradication of sexual abuse, women, transgender people, children, and gay and heterosexual men in recent years have empowered themselves by giving testimonials about their mistreatment, including domestic abuse, rape, incest, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. As such, these survivors not only call attention to these horrible offenses, but quite often they demand justice. This transformation, without question, has reframed the notion of self-worth among the survivors of these despicable abuses. Using a similar mode of operandi, this proposed session looks closely at racism as an ongoing and salient reality in contemporary America, one that affects the lives of millions daily. The roundtable specifically examines racisms hold on scholars in academe, especially within the humanities and social-sciences academy. Racism is hardly a new phenomenon. Like W. E. B. Du Boiss quandary over the problem of the color line in The Souls of Black Folk (1903) more than a century ago, this academic session recognizes that racism remains a pressing difficulty. This panel therefore attempts to stimulate discussions about the ways in which racism affects and alters the lives of scholars teaching in academic departments nationwide. This session attempts to move academic disciplines toward a rediscovery and acknowledgement of this problem for the purpose of self-healing. Like the victims of sexual abuse and violence, the recipients of structural racism are affected in a myriad of ways. As well, through their experiences they learn coping techniques in an effort to resist and survive their quagmire. Women of color in the twenty-first century, according to historian Stephanie Y. Evans, represent 2 percent of all tenured faculty at United States institutions of higher education, while men of color comprise 8 percent of tenured professors. How do people of color as academics navigate the waters of higher education? What relationships do they depend upon in their daily interactions with students, colleagues, staffers, and the community? Do these historians see racism as a hindrance to their upward mobility? If so, how do they rise above such hostilities and disillusionment? How do these&nbsp;academics deal with these encounters daily and remain objective, diligent, and outstanding as degree-trained historians. Finally, does racism lead to isolation among this subgroup of professors? Do women and men of color rely on isolation as a mechanism of survival? Does isolation, at the same time, cause conundrums for these professionals of color? Relying on the voices of women scholars of color, this panel addresses institutional inequity as an ongoing impediment as well as studies isolation as an appropriate or inappropriate response to this reality. Some utilize isolation to hold negativity at bay in order to remain productive and active. Europeanist and Americanist Nupur Chaudhuri reflects on one of the most isolating periods of her adult life. Dr. Chaudhuri in Just Because Your Husband or Dad Has a Ph.D., We Have to Give You a Ph.D.: An Indian Womans Journey towards the Ph.D., reflects on a painful vivid memory. As she prepared for her dissertation defense at her Midwestern public university, the young Indian national faced numerous attacks on her self-esteem, intellect, and culture. Not even the illness of her mother back in India could erode the onslaught of racism.Others rely on their own networks inside and outside their institutions and successfully interweave positive images of self-awareness, self-expression, and self-love, even while relying on some form of isolation for survival purposes. Dr. Joan Cartwright, an influential jazz and blues artist, communication studies scholar, and business marketing executive, despite her inability to secure fulltime teaching employment in her home state of Florida or elsewhere, has soared as a musical artist, writer, and motivational speaker. In No Work for Black PhD Women, Prof Cartwright examines racial exclusion in higher education. Her response to racism includes institution building from the inside out—institutions that ensure the feasibility and success of Black women.Many, on the other hand, artfully refrain from complete seclusion, instead seeing this mode of survival as harmful to their productivity and presence in higher education. Dr. Bernadette Pruitt, has delicately crossed the landmines of race at her institution and within her community, even while continuously sensing that isolation, whether welcomed or not, remains a major component to her existence as an African-descent scholar whose roots begin in West Africa, the American South, and the streets of Detroit, Michigan. In The Double Consciousness of a Beautiful Soul in Higher Education, Pruitt discusses her ultimate destiny of pursuing a more balanced approach to living as a Black woman in higher education—one that celebrates both her Blackness and other heritages while, at the same time, understanding and sharing with the world the ways in which Black culture and consciousness bring essence and success to society, including academe on the whole. Scholars who use this model find waysto connect with colleagues, even condescending and insensitive coworkers, to build lasting intellectual connections and political alliances in order to remain prolific. These academics also remain true to their inner selves, even relying on the sustainability of isolation. The session hopes to inspire continued dialogues among scholars in general, especially academics of color, on this very important topic. The author of this proposal does remain hopeful that ongoing conversations and publications will move theacademy closer toward eradicating structural inequity forever.&nbsp;</p>","Structural Racism And Isolation In Academia, 1970–2020"

This panel seeks to destabilize such silences, elisions, and simplifications by first mobilizing the insights of disability historians within an intersectional and postcolonial frame, and then circling back to the familiar archives of madness. Focusing on the network of institutions established in New York state, the panelists chart a course from blackface minstrelsy at the antebellum asylum to the entanglement of colonial projects and suicide prevention at the turn of the twentieth century, and concludes with the somatic therapies popularized on the eve of deinstitutionalization. In doing so, they attend to the diversity of lived experiences in these spaces, as well as to the dynamic and complex subjectivities that were made, remade, and unmade below the homogenizing discourses of asylum records.Hyoseol Ha discusses the New York State Lunatic Asylums female minstrelsy group, Blackbird Minstrels, which epitomized identity crossings within the institution. Performing as colored subjects animated by crazier antics, patient-performers veiled their own othered bodies, masquerading instead as those who were un/equally oppressed and perpetually othered. Ha argues that the Blackbird Minstrels appropriation of Blackness gestured toward a juncture where boundaries between race, gender, and mental illness were redrawn, social pathologies re-hierarchized, and disability made hypervisible. The Utica archive informs the second paper, as well, in which Kathleen Brian interrogates the colonial dimensions of nineteenth-century therapeutics. Building on recent work that underscores collusions between American psychiatry and the U.S. state, she argues that accounting for asylum medicine means accounting for Anglophone colonial projects—and that suicide is a particularly revealing lens through which to do so. By attending to the opioids, iron bars, and rubber feeding tubes meant to prevent self-accomplished death, she shows that coloniality mattered not only for the experiences of institutionalized indigenous and African-American persons, but for the very functionality of the institutions themselves. Finally, Shuko Tamao shifts toward Bellevue Hospital to interrogate twentieth-century experiments in electroconvulsive therapy that were carried out on children. This therapeutic experience generated two very different narrative currents: Dr. Lauretta Benders medical documents, and the traumatic memories of her child-subject, Ted Chabasinski. Examining the emergence of these competing narratives, Tamao argues that they foreground the role of class dynamics in psychiatrist-patient power struggles. Even as they traverse this broad historical terrain, the panelists create a complex portrait of the the quotidian struggles that, within the asylum, played out at the level of bodies, senses, and subjectivities. Such excavations, they suggest, function as points of entry into larger historiographical problems such as the negotiation of intersectional identities, the multiple connections between institutional intersubjectivity and institutionalized relations of power, and the ableist assumptions embedded in historical practice.</p>","Subjectivizing Madness: Bodies, Senses, And Experiences In The Long History Of The Asylum"

Teaching about race and race relations became a much more important part of history curricula at every level in the 1960s, as the influence of the Civil Rights movement, Black Nationalism, the American Indian movement, La Raza, and other organizations that supported minority rights impelled educators to incorporate previously neglected topics into the curriculum and in classrooms ranging from elementary schools to colleges and universities. Educators and activists sought not only to include the history of minority groups in the curriculum, but to change the way that race relations and history were taught. Because teaching about race relations was a new topic, it inspired new pedagogies. Collectively, these papers offer a history of the inclusion of race into the curriculum and a look at significant approaches to teaching race from the 1960s to the present, ranging from to innovative pedagogies on American Indians to flipped classrooms in which students interrogate the way that slavery is taught in schools and textbooks to simulation games designed to model racial inequality.&nbsp;</p>","Teaching Difficult Racial Histories In Post–Civil Rights America"

O. J. Simpson, the spectacle of a public tribunal determining questions of life and liberty has long captured the imagination of the country.  Each scholar on this roundtable teaches a course on the theme of famous trials in American history.  The session will proceed as an open conversation led by the chair with the participation of the audience encouraged.We will explore how famous trials courses can help students address questions about both the law and the broader social context in which legal proceedings took place: How has the conduct of trials shaped American attitudes about justice?  Why have certain trials served as proxy battles for larger political fights?  How have representations of trials in art and theater informed popular memory?  Each scholars course seeks to expand beyond legal history and consider what trials might have to teach students about the nations political, social, and cultural past.Attention will be afforded to both primary and secondary sources that are helpful on syllabi.  Newspapers, court records, and, for more recent trials, audio-visual materials can all give students insight into proceedings and how contemporaries made sense of a given trial.  While trials receive disproportionately little attention from legal scholars, much of the historiography that does exist is excellent and accessible to students.  Panelists will talk about which books have proven the most useful in the classroom and how to pair secondary sources with documents from the historical record.Roundtable participants will also consider how their own research on famous trials informs their approach to pedagogy. Additional topics include the learning curve in creating and implementing a famous trials course, with an eye toward aiding other scholars who might consider offering such a course at their institutions.Douglas Linder (University of Missouri-Kansas City Law), an award-winning teacher and scholar, will chair the session.

Most of these students had good academic standing overall and simply cannot be dismissed as bad students. The study found that race, family income level, gender, and status as a first-generation college student were the best predictors of who would not succeed in introductory level history courses. Even worse, doing poorly in the history courses had significant implications, as it was highly correlated with the decision to drop out of college. The Gardner Institute report concluded that the ways we are currently teaching introductory level history may be subtly but effectively promoting inequity.  David Pace concurred, arguing that although is very appealing to imagine that the history classroom is a level playing field, where students willingness to work hard determines their level of success, in fact some ineffective teaching and evaluation strategies tend to perpetuate the economic and social divisions among the students in our classes. Faculty may unintentionally be sending a message to privileged, pre-educated students that they are worthy and marginalizing the rest. Fortunately, as Pace noted, these unequal outcomes are not inevitable. Findings from the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SOTL) in a variety of fields (on the topics of transparency and assignment design, motivation and student persistence, syllabus language, reduction of stereotype threat, best practices for discussion, belonging, and classroom climate) help explain factors that contribute to the problem.  The literature also provides some practical advice about how to teach inclusively. Although many of us have good intentions, we may not be familiar with this scholarship. This two-hour, collaborative and interactive workshop is intended for college-level history instructors who are interested in considering ways to empower students of all identities to learn effectively while simultaneously challenging them and maintaining our professions standards for historical work. Graduate students are especially welcome.The workshop will focus on the following topics:•What we mean by an inclusive classroom•Inclusive content (topics, readings, goals, and assignments)•How we can build an inclusive classroom climate•What we communicate to students (explicitly and subtly) about fairness, inclusion, and challenge.The workshop will include a blend of methods, including the sharing of relevant research, discussion, collaborative brainstorming, and reflection about how one might apply inclusive principles to ones own courses.</p>","Teaching Inclusively: An Interactive Workshop"

That is, violence organized in the service of an articulated political program. This, she argued, was not only strange but a relatively recent historiographical development. Gilded age and progressive era historians and public intellectuals, for example, took it for granted that the U.S. was plagued with ideological violence. This paper session considers violence, coercion and illegal activity in American political and economic history. The papers assembled look at the use of violence in the regulation of labor markets; conflicting definitions of violence offered by workers and employers respectively; the relationship between violence, property and control; and the legitimacy of the very division between ideological and non-ideological violence. A number of recent contributions have returned to the role of violence, radicalism and labor conflict in the formation of American political institutions. The work of Christopher Capozzola on vigilantism and patriotism during WWI; Laura Weinribs reinsertion of labor conflict into the history of civil rights; Philip Gourevitchs emphasis on the coercive nature of strikes; and Gages work on left-wing violence and radical terrorism are among them. The role of open, often violent conflict between workers and employers has been well-established and the relationship between criminal organizations and labor unions is also widely documented but each of these papers reconsiders the terms of these debates. Andy Battle revisits the role of the mafia in the Northeast garment industry as an organization running parallel to, rather than against the interests of legitimate manufacturers and entrepreneurs. Thai Jones looks at how workers in the mines of Goldfield, Nevada fashioned a distinct class-based vision of property rights through the practice of supplementing wages with theft. Rebecca Lossin argues that the large body of literature on sabotage produced by the Industrial Workers of the World was not a mere soap-boxing tactic, but posed a significant economic and political threat by casting an established practice of property destruction in coherent political terms. Christian Parenti revisits the work of W.J. Cash for an analysis of Southern political economy in which class struggle, labor politics, elite hegemony, and violence played a decisive role.</p>","The Contested Use Of Force: Violence, Theft, And Property Destruction In Political And Economic Struggle"

In a world divided into sovereign states with unequal economic and political standing, the promise of equality rarely extends beyond national boundaries. Within national boundaries, these promises are often reserved for citizens. Struggles in crossing borders and the rights claims of immigrants are challenges to rectify inequality. Historically, how have socio-political, economic, and cultural contexts and the international relations of the U.S. and the immigrants home countries shaped the perceptions of and responses to immigration and immigrants? As scholars such as K. Benton-Cohen, the chair of the panel, suggest, in the U.S., it was only in the early 20th century that immigration came to be framed as a problem that can be managed. The three papers in this panel examine groups and networks of immigration specialists, activists, reformers, and government agents, who emerged in the early- to mid-20th century, as well as immigrant responses to these actors. Through a relational and comparative lens, the panel explores historical ideas about the inclusion and exclusion of immigrants and addresses the question of equality and inequality.   The first paper (Ichimasa) examines female activists in the early 20th century. Ichimasa will focus on Emily Greene Balch (1867-1961), one of the most important activists in American settlement and womens peace movements. Analyzing a range of works and documents produced by Balch, this study explores how womens social movements formed images of racial, national, and ethnic boundaries and fixed gender roles for minority groups. The paper also illustrates how women involved in social movements envisioned a global network of women for peace through personal experiences and relationships with immigrants and other activists.  The second paper (Oda) studies pre-WWII immigration reformers and traces the origins of post-WWII liberal immigration reform back to the late 1920s and the 1930s. This paper mainly discusses one of the oldest liberal immigration reform coalitions, the Joint Conference on Immigration Policy formed in 1930 that was reorganized into the American Immigration Conference in 1953. Oda argues that early efforts to promote cross-faith and cross-ethnic cooperation to counter eugenicist restrictionism laid both the ideological and organizational foundations of post-WWII reform for a more equal immigration policy.  The third paper (Izumi) discusses the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII, one of the foremost violations of the equal protection of citizens. Izumis paper focuses on federal agents who administered the War Relocation Centers established to detain, manage, and release Japanese Americans excluded in the Pacific Coast. By combining archived findings and theories, this study attempts to present a more holistic understanding of officials involved in the wartime management of Japanese Americans. The paper will go beyond the question of whether Japanese American internment was racist or not, and contextualize this historical episode in the shifting relationship between race, liberalism, and social engineering by the U.S. federal government.</p>","The Emergence Of Immigration Specialists: Ideas About Inclusion And Exclusion Of Immigrants In The Early To Mid-20th Century"

Instead of tackling these problems, many mainstream thinkers and policymakers came to embrace the idea of state failure as policy solution. How do we explain this rapid shift? Why was the tradition of large-scale state intervention in social and economic life—a defining purpose of the US federal government since the New Deal—abandoned in favor of a strategy of disinvestment? How did a narrow concept of fiscal responsibility come to replace more capacious understandings of the states obligations to its citizenry? And what are the links between the defunding of foreign aid programs and the weakening of the social contract at home?The three panelists together bring a wide range of perspectives to these questions. Sheyda Jahanbani&quot;s paper will explore changing notions of the proper role of the state in promoting nation-building abroad in the wake of the Vietnam War, and how this moment of crisis empowered non-state actors to take up nation building projects on behalf of the U.S. government. Sarah Miller-Davenport will investigate the ways in which letting New York fail came to be seen as an increasingly viable option for the Ford administration during the city&quot;s 1975 fiscal crisis, and how the city itself adopted a policy of strategic abandonment of poor neighborhoods in favor of a strengthened commitment to Wall Street. Shaul Mitelpunkt&quot;s paper will examine how in the late 1960s and early 1970s American scholars, entertainers, and policymakers invented ethical justifications to ending conscription, presenting the swift demolition of the citizen-soldier order as a measure that would usher in a more just society.</p>","The Fractured State: U.S. Responsibilities At Home And Abroad In The 1970s"

In particular, the panel addresses how in turn-of-the-century capitalism able-bodiedness was tied to self-responsibility. As dis/ability scholars have argued, the development of industrial capitalism and wage labor in the nineteenth century brought with it a modern imperative of able-bodiedness. Taylorist concepts of scientific management and efficiency created new norms for the classification of productive bodies, as well as their ability to work and to govern themselves. The homo oeconomicus—the enterprising self—became the ableist ideal of the era. Studies on Racial Capitalism have recently pointed out anew how the structural exploitation of black working bodies continued beyond slavery, through systems of debt obligations, expropriation, and other property politics. These processes were perpetuated by the devaluation of black bodies and selves.By pairing up these two perspectives – the critiques of ableism and racism – the papers of this panel will focus on political economies of the body that produced inequality through racialized ideals of able-bodiedness and self-responsibility. They scrutinize how the perceived inability to self-manage labor and the fruits of ones labor was a crucial rationale for colonizing people, while the capacity to maintain ones labor power and to acquire and manage property signified economic and individual success. In the post-slavery era, African Americans access to land ownership and the fruits of their labor became a field of intense negotiation. While some former slaves may have profited from their own work by building up a small portion of property, the vast majority remained in a cycle of having to exploit themselves for the profit of white landowners. Processes of expropriation were based on rendering African Americans as not credible or not capable of exercising economic citizenship. This contributed to cementing the image of homo oeconomicus as being white.Autonomy, a key ability of liberal citizenship in the decades around 1900, seemed increasingly legible on peoples bodies. Bodies—their shape and health—appeared to be the fruits of ones labor on oneself. In the era of the survival of the fittest, the American ideal of the self made man became updated and connected to the self-made body. Improving ones body became a privileged site for white middle-class men demonstrating their capability of responsible self-government.By scrutinizing the nexus of ability, race, and work, the panel sheds new light on the body history of capitalism and inequality in the US. The first paper discusses how Walt Whitman—in a little-known newspaper column—called upon white middle-class men to work on their bodies in order to claim political power. The second paper analyzes the practice of sharecropping as a pivot in reorganizing racist hierarchies via debts politics in a post-slavery economy. The third paper addresses how early human capital theory linked able-bodiedness to capitalist prosperity and devised ways of how individuals could increase their body capital. The fourth paper shows how time work management in the interwar years created new taxonomies and hierarchies of racial and bodily fitness.</p>","The Fruit Of Ones Labor?

While it was best known for its ecumenical work, these papers examine lesser known moments in the organizations history that nonetheless shaped its political trajectory. Put together, the papers demonstrate that the FCC/NCC has been dedicated to a substantial expansion of its progressive interests, including internationalism, sex education, and sexual orientation. At each effort, it was successful to a degree, leading to significant impacts on American society and religion, yet its shortcomings—due to contextual challenges, miscalculations, and compromises—and unintended consequences reverberated for decades into the present. These historical ironies of progressive intentions gone awry highlight the role of the FCC/NCC in inspiring conservative backlash and shaping the polarization of American religious politics. The first paper sets the scope of the FCCs vision, in this case to help found the United Nations. The paper advances two inter-related arguments, each of which clarifies the role of international engagement in the fate of the Protestant mainline. On the one hand, it contends that liberal Protestant global encounters in the mid-twentieth century nurtured capacious new spiritual sensibilities that heralded the emergence of a post-Protestant spiritual but not religious ethos. On the other hand, the growing internationalism of ecumenical Protestantism fostered a significant backlash marked most especially by the formation of the National Association of Evangelicals. The second paper illustrates that the FCC wanted to transform the domestic sphere as well, through the development of American public sex education. This paper argues that the FCC became the practical arm of the sex education movement in the 1920s and 30s through its partnership with the American Social Hygiene Association. As such, it played a central role in the sex education movements shift away from venereal disease education toward family life education. While its religious contributions made sex education more acceptable to a broader public, it also constrained the topic of sexuality to heterosexual Christian marriage.   The third paper details the NCCs debates over whether to include the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches, a new denomination that affirmed homosexuality. The Fellowships application letter for Council membership, delivered in 1981, started a decade-long conversation that ended in deep disappointment on both sides. The paper analyzes four issues shaping the contour and outcome of those debates: institutional vs. lived ecumenism, tensions between out and closeted homosexual Christians, the rise of the Christian right, and the catastrophe of AIDS. This paper demonstrates that the NCCs desire to expand its progressive interests were selective and limited in terms of religious and political adaptability. These papers will be followed by a response from a leading scholar of the NCC. Together, they will shed light on the specific contributions of the FCC/NCC to contentious cultural discussions surrounding globalism and sexuality within the history of American religious progressivism. </p>","The History Of The National Council Of Churches And Religious Progressivism"

Outraged supporters declared that sending the ordinance back to committee was merely an attempt to kill the issue. Over a period of three weeks, the councils Finance Committee had heard more than twelve hours of public testimony from hundreds of citizens. Supporters and opponents orchestrated massive campaigns, flooding City Hall with a record-setting amount of phone calls, letters, and demonstrations. By the time that Ordinance 65430 came before the full city council for an official vote, it had already proven to be one of the most (if not the most) controversial pieces of legislation in Kansas Citys history. Utilizing over fifty hours of oral history interviews with the Kansas City activists, community organizers, and politicians directly involved in fighting for the passage of nondiscrimination legislation for LGBTQ communities and people with HIV/AIDS, this film contextualizes the controversy surrounding Ordinance 65430 within the broader resurgence of Kansas City LGBTQ activism fueled by the AIDS epidemic. Throughout the late 1980s, AIDS activists frequently made their voices heard on the steps of City Hall, often through controversial tactics which led to infighting among activists and politicians alike. As one of the only major metropolitan areas to introduce protections based upon sexual orientation and HIV-status in the same piece of legislation, Kansas Citys fight for a civil rights ordinance is the perfect focal point to better understand how the issues of homophobia and the fear of AIDS were not only intertwined—they were inseparable. In 2017, University of Missouri-Kansas City doctoral candidate and public historian Austin R. Williams partnered with Stuart Hinds, curator of the Gay and Lesbian Archive of Mid-America (GLAMA) to launch a crowdfunding campaign in order raise the travel funds and film equipment necessary to collect the oral histories of the individuals involved in this historic civil rights campaign. After this film screening, Williams and Hinds will be on hand to answer questions and discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with turning an oral history project into a documentary film.The Ordinance Project won the Courage Award for best feature-length documentary at the 2018 Kansas City LGBT Film Festival.

This lack of attention is particularly glaring for the era between the American Revolution and Reconstruction, when Canada nearly disappears from the index of many syntheses, even though the two polities remain connected by migration, rebellion, ideology, a cross-border community, and a shared economy.  Despite this neglect, in recent years scholarship focused on the U.S.-Canadian border, and on the continuing relationship between the United States and British North America more generally, has reached a critical mass, as both U.S. and Canadian historians have probed ongoing connections, surprising comparisons, and important contrasts between the two fledgling nations.This panel brings together an array of such scholars to interrogate Canadas important role in the development of U.S. history during the early republic and the Civil War eras, as well as the United States role in Canadian history.  It will probe questions surrounding Indigenous Peoples, migration and expatriation, race relations, political ideology, and rebellion and civil war.  In particular, it will address a topic pertinent to the OAHs theme of (In)equality: the long-held truism of North American history that the United States was more free but less equal, in contrast to Canada, which was a bastion of equality yet clamped down on liberty.

Medical professionals documented the first footfalls of what came to be known as HIV/AIDS in the summer of 1981 when mysterious maladies were noted among five gay men. The condition soon mushroomed into the greatest public health crisis since World War II. More than 700,000 people have died of AIDS in the U.S., and 1.2 million people (half of them fifty years of age or older) are HIV positive today. Any epidemic of this magnitude would have posed a monumental challenge, but the demographics of HIV raised stark question of rights and inequalities that challenged the straight state.The epidemic initially affected primarily gay men, injection drug users, and hemophiliacs. Although women were at risk, gendered assumptions inhibited that recognition for some time. By the 1990s HIV affected, disproportionately, people of color. Today half of all African American men who have sex with men are predicted to become HIV positive. HIV/AIDS broke along major fault lines of American politics: It first affected primarily reviled minorities (gay men and drug users) and came to be embroiled in the maelstrom of racial politics. The methods of transmission – sex and drugs – were topics politicians prefer to avoid, noted Peter Piot, the United Nations under secretary who headed the organizations HIV effort. For some politicians, the outsider status of the groups most affected sanctioned indifference and even made them inviting targets.The purpose of this session is to analyze some key facets of the politics of AIDS in the first twenty years of the epidemic in the U.S. Presidential leadership was largely absent. Although the Ronald Reagan administrations indifference, even hostility, is well known, the internal dynamics of administration decision making invite further analysis. Some believe George H.W. Bush wished to take more constructive action, but he yielded to a conservative backlash and was willing to stigmatize people with AIDS (PWAs) for political purposes. Bill Clinton told PWAs I feel your pain but shrank from politically risky interventions. Although the politics of AIDS is sometimes framed in a liberal/conservative dichotomy, the reality is more complicated. Most liberal politicians wanted to avoid talking about sex and drugs. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was a notable exception. Drawing on his extensive background in welfare politics, he worked to provide support for PWAs through the Social Security system. His approach to HIV politics engaged the enduring debate about the states responsibility in the context of the deserving and undeserving. The ripples of AIDS politics included significant participation by women activists, who mobilized to inform women about their risks of HIV, press the government (and some male-dominated activist groups) to recognize the health care needs of HIV-positive women, and to broaden the struggle to include reproductive rights. AIDS politics moved from the margins to the center of American political discourse.</p>","The Politics Of Aids In The 1980s And 1990s"

The focus of this scholarship—by Elizabeth Hinton (2016), Heather Ann Thompson (2016), and many others—has concentrated on the federal level as the primary site where state officials produced the expansion of the carceral state. However, inspired by work from historians such as Dan Berger (2014), this panel seeks to shift the lens from federal policy to the local level and suggest the centrality of local actors to the history of the criminal justice system. The panelists all expose how the punitive turn in American life was not natural nor inevitable but the product of historically contingent political struggles, ones in which social movements at the local and state levels played a key role. A second, related way in which the panel investigates the history of the American carceral state from the bottom up is by incorporating marginalized historical actors whose perspectives typically do not find representation in historical narratives—most especially youth. As all of the panelists argue, youth, in different ways, played a central role in mounting resistance to criminalization. At the same time, the lives of many young people were fundamentally shaped by punitive policies and laws and their enforcement. We examine this history by focusing on two groups that experienced this punitive turn in specific ways: Black youth and LGBTQ people (including LGBTQ youth). In Bad Queers, Scott De Orio examines how, during the pivotal era of the long 1970s, LGBT activists, feminists, law enforcement officials, and many others redefined what types of gender and sexual conduct it was legitimate for sex crime law to criminalize, in the process creating a new, criminal underclass of bad queers. Michael Stauchs paper, Young Boys, examines the criminalization of Black youth who turned to the informal economy during the leadership of Detroits first African-American mayor, Coleman A. Young. In A Case for Local Histories of the High School Student Organizing Tradition and Its Responses to the Punitive Turn, 1968–1973, Dara Walker offers a comparative study of Black youths resistance to the punitive turn, drawing on the experiences of high school student activists in Detroit, Los Angeles, and Mississippi. Austin McCoys paper, Detroit Under STRESS, illustrates how the killings of two black youths spurred the development of a campaign to confront the use of lethal force, critique liberal theories of crime and open up possibilities for reform.In sum, this panel offers an opportunity for urban historians and scholars of social movements to examine political struggles in local contexts that, we argue, were central to the development of the punitive turn in American governance and to the resistance thereof. In the process, it provides a forum in which to bring in youth as historical actors and consider the ways in which they shaped and were shaped by the carceral state.</p>","The Punitive Turn From Below: Grassroots Histories Of The Carceral Era"

Repeatedly over the course of the nineteenth century, African Americans contested the presumed boundaries of the body politic, advancing demands for emancipation, civil rights, and equality to the forefront of national political discussions. For these activists, calling attention to the injustice of slavery was one pillar of a much larger political project. Working both within and outside the conventional channels of electoral politics, and on both local and national scales, they aimed to combat the dual evils of slavery and racism that plagued nineteenth-century society, and they struggled to establish an equal voice for themselves in American politics. The power of black activists claims is reflected in the responses of their white opponents, ranging from elite advocates for colonization to fire-breathing planter-politicians, who argued that the granting of any such rights would threaten the very foundations of American society. In the minds of both white and black Americans, black political activism was inseparable from the issue of abolishing slavery, but it also encompassed other equally significant claims to civil and political equality. Black Americans antebellum advocacy for equal rights, long overlooked, has recently gained prominence in scholarly discussions, which highlight the contributions of ordinary African Americans to nationwide legal and political debates. This panel will engage with recent scholarship, while also presenting new research strands in the field of antebellum black politics. The panel will bring together various approaches to the topic of nineteenth-century African American politics, ranging from suffrage, citizenship, and partisan politics, to more informal means of political action, as well as accounting for white reactions to black political mobilization. For a cohort of African Americans, antislavery and anti-racist activism went along with daily contests for justice, equity, and individual fulfillment. Together, the panel aims to contribute to the ongoing and vibrant conversation about the meaning of nineteenth-century politics and the various means of protest deployed by black Americans in their struggle for freedom and equal rights. </p>","The Question Of Black Politics In The Antebellum United States"

Then the floor would be opened to general discussion lasting forty-five minutes.&nbsp; Three commentators have agreed to participate: Quinn Slobodian, Wellesley College, Boston; Melinda Cooper, University of Melbourne, Australia; and Peter Hudson, UCLA.&nbsp; &nbsp;We have attached CVs for each of the commentators, as well as for Gerstle and Burgin.&nbsp; Slobodian and Cooper have published two of the most acclaimed books on neoliberalism to appear these last few years.&nbsp; Hudson has published a much-praised book on the twentieth-century history of capitalism and race in the Caribbean and North America.&nbsp; Slobodian would bring an international perspective, Cooper one focused on gender and family values, and Hudson one focused on race.&nbsp; We could not have hoped for a better set of commentators.&nbsp; Burgin, a leading historian of neoliberalism in his own right, will chair the session.<br>Our motives for proposing this panel are twofold:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>First, neoliberalism is one of the most frequently used words to discuss the global and domestic politics of the last fifty years.&nbsp; It is an enormously popular subject among young scholars.&nbsp; The AHA sponsored a not-very-good panel on this subject last year, and it still drew more than 150 people. Yet the meaning of the term can be elusive and attempts to use it to interpret historical formations have sometimes lacked rigor. This session will attempt to identify the most useful meanings of the term and to test their relevance to recent American history.&nbsp; Gerstles interest in the subject lies less with tracking the genealogy of the term and more with its application to American politics.&nbsp; He is most interested in reconstructing the circumstances (economic, political social) that first made it possible for the idea of neoliberalism to sustain a political order and then what pushed this order into crisis. His model in that regard is the rise and fall of the New Deal order, a concept that he pioneered with Steve Fraser in their classic work of that title, now thirty years old.&nbsp; &nbsp;The book that Gerstle is currently writing is a sequel to his earlier co-edited book, and it will cover a similar half-century swath of time.&nbsp; &nbsp;He will have written half of this book by the time of next years OAH—a perfect moment for him to present and to receive feedback.<br>Second, senior scholars almost never present their own new work at OAH conventions; they serve mostly as chairs, commentators, and as talking heads on the state of their field or on retrospective examinations of their own work.&nbsp; Those are valuable roles but constricted ones, for they limit what these meetings can be as intellectual occasions. One major disincentive for senior scholars is having only fifteen-twenty minutes to present their work.&nbsp; The kind of session that we are proposing converts a disincentive to present work at the OAH into an incentive.&nbsp; Note that we are not proposing to give Gerstle a soapbox, in the form of an hour-long lecture; rather we are proposing to subject his work to serious commentary and interrogation.&nbsp;<br>In some OAH quarters, this kind of session—senior scholar, precirculated paper, serious interrogation—is referred to as the Gerstle option. It has been tried in past OAHs with good results.&nbsp; If this revival were to be successful, subsequent program committees could be encouraged to take it up themselves.&nbsp; Over a decade, the annual convention could then have the benefit of early exposure to scores of new projects by senior scholars.&nbsp; This exposure might help to enhance the annual convention as an intellectual occasion.&nbsp;<br>Proceeding with this event requires some extra work on the part of OAH staff, especially in terms of writing instructions for the Annual Meeting website that would allow registrants to get a hold of Gerstles paper by clicking various links.&nbsp; But once that work is done, circulation of the paper ought to proceed by something close to automatic pilot.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the past, for sessions of this sort, those historians not registered for the OAH wanting to read the paper were invited to write the paper giver directly asking for a copy.&nbsp; The paper giver can then make his/her own decisions about how widely to distribute it.&nbsp; The OAH meanwhile is removed from have to worry about such matters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","The Rise And Fall Of Americas Neoliberal Order"

This break was to take place in the realm of geopolitics: from now on, no king would rule over the thirteen colonies-cum¬-states from distant European shores. The separation was also supposed to be ideological and cultural. Monarchical subjects would become republican citizens, loyal not to the image of an individual king but to the idea of a sovereign people. Though historians have disagreed strenuously about the particulars of this transition, until recent years they have rarely deviated from the basic assumption that Americans quickly fulfilled the Declarations vision of a total abandonment of monarchical political culture. Lately, however, several highly stimulating studies have called into question the neatness of this narrative. Eric Nelson has argued that many leading patriots of the 1760s and 70s pitched their opposition to British policies as a defense of royal government against a tyrannical Parliament; though largely dormant during the years of the Revolutionary War itself, this royalist persuasion came roaring back during the creation of the Federal Constitutions muscular, quasi-monarchical presidency. Caitlin Fitzs work suggests that Anglo-Americans remained fixated upon kingship long after their own revolution, imagining the Spanish American rebels of the 1810s and 20s as partners in a common hemispheric struggle against monarchy. Meanwhile, Marcela Echeverris study of popular royalism among a diverse swath of revolutionary era South Americans suggests that evidence of monarchisms ongoing manifestations presents scholars interested in a hemisphere-wide Age of Revolution with a fertile field for comparison and connection. The papers of this panel will take up the mantle presented by these studies and others, arguing that monarchy was (technically) gone but hardly forgotten in the political culture of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century United States. Though U.S. citizens agreed that no American ruler would wear a crown, political structures, practices, rituals, and images drawn from Americans long monarchical apprenticeship lingered both in official state policies and in partisan rhetoric. Our first two presenters, Lindsay Chervinsky and Zachary Conn, will suggest that defining the activities of the presidents cabinet officers and his representatives to Native Americans involved more direct borrowing from British monarchical precedents than scholars have previously recognized.  Shira Lurie and Mark Boonshoft will then lead us out of the young Republics sites of formal governance and into its classrooms and streets. In sparring over the roles of social class in education policy and popular protest in legislative debates, Federalists and Democratic-Republicans offered competing understandings of the ways in which the establishment of a republic had, and had not, banished Americas old monarchical political culture. Collectively, the papers will suggest that for decades after 1776 the retreat from monarchy was no simple matter. Instead, it was characterized by unevenness, complexity, and meaningful disagreement. </p>","Traces Of Monarchy In Early U.S. Political Culture"

Recent work on the history of inequality in the United States, particularly the economic inequality fostered by the United States turn to neoliberalism in the late twentieth century, has examined the trans-Atlantic roots of modern American economic and political thought and practice. Yet in the late twentieth century, many Americans had set their gaze firmly across the Pacific. The financial and political rise of East Asia seemingly augured a new economic and geopolitical future, while an expanding flow of migrants and refugees transformed the demographic, political, and social makeup of the United States. Drawing from their own research, the participants in this roundtable will examine diverse trans-Pacific crossings, from migrants to money, goods, and ideas, to reflect on how these interactions shaped American conceptions of equality and inequality.  The panelists will reflect on the ways in which interactions between the United States and East Asia intersected with diverse forms of inequality in modern America. How did the expansion of migration from East Asia, including refugees, challenge or alter the concept, reality, and experience of economic, racial, and educational inequality in American life? Did it curtail or enhance movements to expand access to opportunity in the United States? Did it change the main actors within such movements? How did the growth of East Asian economies challenge or justify economic and political practices that facilitated or addressed economic divides? Why did so many people react so strongly to the development of East Asian economies and how did those sentiments help strengthen or weaken the economically interventionist powers of the American state? How did growing flows of money and goods from East Asia, and their impact on American popular, commercial, and leisure culture, exacerbate or mitigate the cultural or economic impact of inequality in peoples everyday lives? By reflecting on inequality as a question of opportunity, policy, and felt experience, this roundtable will bring fresh perspectives to our understanding of recent American cultural, political, social, and economic life. </p>","Trans-Pacific Inequalities"

But while corporate earnings have steadily risen, the wages for long-haul drivers, when corrected for inflation have fallen for the last four decades. In that same time period, the Teamsters Union was pushed out of the deregulated long haul trucking industry and labor conditions worsened, with drivers today often working 60 to 80 hours a week.  Drivers who are lured into becoming independent contractors often find themselves making less than minimum wage, and some are even caught up in a modern form of debt peonage.   These abysmal conditions have pushed more and more drivers out of the industry; estimates put the annual turnover rate for truck drivers at above 95 percent.  Instead of improving work conditions to reduce this turnover, the industrys response has been to push the government to enlarge the labor pool, by amending current restrictions to allow 18-21 year olds to drive interstate freight trucks.  The long term solution, many observers seem to agree, is automation, but although self-driving trucks are in development, their actual deployment onto the nations highways is many years, if not decades in the future.  In the meantime, truck drivers are a prominent and poignant example of a larger pattern of inequality that has marked economic growth in the U.S. for the last three decades.  Workers in general have seen their share of corporate profits fall as declining union strength and precarious employment patterns have allowed employers to squeeze wages and erode working conditions.Historians such as David Witwer have noted the central role that truck drivers have played in twentieth century history, where their strategic power helped make the Teamsters Union by the 1950s both the largest and the most controversial labor organization in the United States.  Shane Hamilton traced the part that truck drivers played in key shifts in the post-World War II economy, especially the agribusiness sector.  More recently, Michael Belzer and Steven Viscelli have described the occupations stark decline since the federal government deregulated interstate trucking.The panelists in this session offer important new perspectives on the history of truck drivers.  David Witwer explores the way in which the controversial Teamster Union president, James R. Hoffa, prefigured Donald Trump, and how the continued loyalty of Hoffas truck driving constituents led many observers to raise questions about the evolution of the working-class.  Anne Balay draws on her own experience as a long haul truck driver, and the oral histories she accumulated among gay and transgender drivers, to describe their distinctive perspective on the declining conditions in this occupation.  But she also presents their efforts to resist that workplace oppression.  Finally, Steve Viscelli uses the history of how mid-twentieth century truckers embraced automation to offer potential policy suggestions for the oncoming new wave of automation poised to transform the occupation again. </p>","Trouble In Trucking Country: Truck Drivers And Their Histories"

It ended a century of legal racial discrimination and extended the franchise to millions of African Americans. Its achievements as well as its failures provide tremendous insight into the promise, practice, and unrealized potential of democracy in America. The key to accessing what civil rights history has to offer is teaching it properly. Unfortunately, the version of the movement that is typically taught frames the struggle incorrectly. This Master Narrative overemphasizes marches, nonviolence, and federal legislation, and deemphasizes grassroots organizing, armed self-defense, and community control.Session OverviewThis session will examine how to teach civil rights history accurately and effectively by interrogating the Master Narrative and suggesting new approaches and practices for civil rights instruction. Panelists will explore new ways of teaching iconic movement people, events, and organizations by giving guidance on how to push beyond the saintly version of Dr. Martin Luther King. They will do the same for women activists by suggesting ways of upending the mistaken notion that Rosa Parks was a tired seamstress who got swept up in the fast flowing currents of history. They will provide a blueprint for how to teach grassroots organizing in a way that centers local people by using the 1964 Mississippi Summer Project as a template.

He routinely made this boastful promise, and many of his boisterous supporters, consisting of a hodgepodge of largely angry, middle and working-class white men and women, sported red MAGA caps at his rallies. His Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, responded to this message with significantly less inspiring words: America is already Great. While the two disagreed about when America was great, they largely agreed that the nations greatness had much to do with the level of prosperity enjoyed by ordinary Americans. Trump romanticized a time when manufacturing jobs were plentiful, and wages were high; Clinton focused on what she perceived as the triumphs of the Obama administration. Trump and Clinton were not the only ones to discuss the matter. The nations greatness, identified by large numbers of politicians, journalists, and historians from across the political spectrum, could be found in earlier times, when the US established itself as the worlds dominant economic powerhouse and when working-class jobs paid middle-class wages. Many liberal-minded historians have embraced a rise and fall of the New Deal order narrative, one that celebrates the Progressive, New Deal, World War II and Civil Rights eras while bemoaning the rise of the conservative movement embodied most visibly by Ronald Reagan. In these narratives, economic growth and increased consumerism press forward as signs of progress, yet the regimes of power controlling, repressing, and dividing the people get a pass as the invisible hand of triumphant capitalism hides its darker side.<br>This three-person panel seeks to historicize and problematize different periods when America was supposedly great. Chad Pearson will examine the Progressive Era, noting how this period should be remembered for giving birth to the modern anti-union movement, one that enjoyed support from some of the periods most influential liberal reformers. Thomas Castillo will explore World War II, highlighting a counter history to FDRs four freedoms. In Castillos view, this was a time when employers used the war to undermine labor rights. For ordinary people, this was a shock doctrine moment rather than a good war. Finally, Dan Clark will challenge the myth of prosperous post-war autoworkers. Rather than enjoying long periods of uninterrupted prosperity, large numbers of 1950s era autoworkers struggled with a boom-and-bust economy, which made their employment situations precarious. Commenting will be Donna Haverty-Stacke, a scholar of labor, culture and the left.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","Was America Ever Great?

In 2019, this slogan and its many variants represent a popular marketing strategy to sell scores of products that promise that the real results of a bodily regime – usually diet or exercise – will be metaphysical. The appeal of such messaging, prevalent in posh private medical practices and strip-mall supplements stores alike, rests on a widely shared assumption that care of the body yields loftier returns than beauty or longevity, and that pursuing these often emotional, spiritual, and intellectual ends is a core commitment of contemporary life. But how has this assumption emerged and why has it become so powerful? How have marginalized groups constructed this ideal differently and fought for the right to pursue it, at times with conflicting strategies? By reaching back more than a century and moving beyond the marketplace to community organizations, the medical profession, and the halls of government, this panel will  explore how Americans have articulated personal health as part of a collective, often political, project. Spanning the 20th and early 21st centuries, the research highlighted on this panel demonstrates that as wellness, broadly defined, has become an increasingly crucial facet of self-actualization, the ability to achieve it has been far from even, and there has been no single definition of what it has meant to be well. While there have been recent historical attempts to make sense of the American pursuit of fitness, the papers on this panel argue that we need an intersectional approach and that no single narrative of fitness or wellness is possible. Instead, this panel builds on historiographies of politics, race, gender, and health to consider the ways in which diverse Americans grappled with their own definitions of fitness. We build on histories of health and fitness in the United States by scholars such as Alondra Nelson, Shelly McKenzie, Samuel Roberts, and Jonathan Metzl to explore both how these structures have emerged and how Americans have both upheld and resisted them to promote the pursuit of physical and mental health. Ava Purkiss argues that in the early 20th century, black women augmented their public health campaigns by integrating exercise into their health activism.  Black women promoted exercise as not only a public health good, but as a physical act that had implications for real and imagined forms of racial competition and posterity. Rachel Louise Moran turns to the 1960s and 70s, when a growing feminist womens health movement took up postpartum depression, but struggled to reach consensus about whether the challenges that mothers faced were about individual wellness or about structural inequalities.Finally, Natalia Mehlman Petrzela historicizes the post-9/11 consensus that exercise is imperative to full selfhood, even as opportunities to engage in fitness activities have become increasingly privatized, rendering wellness another marker of inequality in the modern United States. Moderator Jennifer Nelson will draw on her scholarship on health activism in the United States and abroad to contextualize the American examples we explore.</p>","Wellness, Bodies, And Selfhood In The Modern United States"

During the era of President Donald Trump, top members of the party have embraced some shocking positions, such as calling for tariffs, withdrawing from vital international alliances, rejecting science and truth, and demonstrating open sympathy to white nationalism. These developments have stimulated heated debates among conservatives and throughout the country as to what has happened to the Party of Lincoln, or Ronald Reagan for that matter. As a result, crucial questions have emerged about how the GOP has changed in its character and composition since its creation. Historians are starting to examine the sharp rightward shift of the party, the destructive tactics recently employed in partisan battles and a narrowing electoral base. The roundtable will look at the ideological, institutional, organizational and electoral changes that put the party down this path?  With the next presidential election approaching, this roundtable will bring together some of the best political historians and political scientists to provide historical context to the current situation.</p>","What Happened To The Republican Party?"

In the past 40 years, individuals such as Daniel Ellsberg, Philip Agee, Chelsea Manning, John Kiriakou, and Edward Snowden are only the most famous figures to have shared secret information with the public, and to be variously praised as heroic whistleblowers or stigmatized as traitorous leakers. But how should historians understand the significance of these developments?&nbsp; This Roundtable Discussion features a group of interdisciplinary scholars interested in historicizing the rise of whistleblowing and leaking from a variety of perspectives.&nbsp; It will examine the contested nature of terms and concepts, including a long-running struggle to shape public, political, and legal frameworks. Are disclosures of national security information a remedy to the ills of excessive state secrecy? An act of civil disobedience? An existential threat to national security? Addressing these questions requires an examination of the intertwined histories of whistleblowing and national security since the early twentieth century.&nbsp;<br>The Roundtable Discussion will explore the ways that the subject can shed new light on the history of American law, democracy, political culture, national security, and foreign policy over the course of the twentieth century and into the early twenty-first.

And what sort of legacy?This roundtable approaches these questions from a wide variety of perspectives. The participants have all written books on the history of New Plymouth, several of which will appear in print early in 2020. Frank Bremer, author of many books on trans-Atlantic puritanism, has a forthcoming book on the religious culture of the Pilgrims and their impact on the development of New England Congregationalism. David Silverman&quot;s This Land Is Their Land, a Wampanoag-centered history of New Plymouth, will also be published in 2020, as will John G. Turner&quot;s The Lord&quot;s Free People, an examination of a liberty and bondage in Plymouth Colony. Two participants have already published noteworthy books on the subject. Lisa Brooks is the author of Our Beloved Kin, an innovative Native-centered history of King Philip&quot;s War. The participants represent a number of disciplinary homes (History, Religious Studies, and English), backgrounds, institutions. In other words, the panelists are ideally suited to explore the many stories and legacies of Plymouth Colony.Moderator Adrian Weimer (author of Martyr&quot;s Mirror: Persecution and Holiness in Early New England) will begin with a number of fundamental questions. Does what one historian recently described as &quot;a periphery on the periphery&quot; have any importance beyond Mayflower genealogy and tourism? If so, what is that significance? The separatists who comprised a majority of Mayflower passengers: what did they believe? Returning to a longstanding historiographical debate that includes Perry Miller and Michael Winship, to what extent did Plymouth influence the trajectory of Massachusetts Bay congregationalism? And to what extent did separatism continue to animate the culture of what eventually became known as the &quot;Old Colony?&quot; How did the experiences of dissenters from New Plymouth&quot;s Congregational establishment differ from their counterparts in other colonies? Do the finer distinctions of English Protestantism matter in light of the displacement, enslavement, and exportation of many Native women, men, and children? By the time New Plymouth became part of a larger province of Massachusetts Bay in 1692, English colonists had conquered and colonized most of the land within Plymouth&quot;s claimed jurisdiction and had reduced remaining Native communities to the status of subject peoples. Was the outcome different than in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, or -- for that matter -- Virginia or New France? If so, how?The 2020 events -- in Massachusetts, in Leiden, and in the UK -- will involve celebrations, gatherings of mourning, and -- organizers hope -- commerce. What, by contrast, would it mean for Americans to think historically about the Mayflower anniversary and the events that followed it?</p>","Whose Anniversary? 2020, The Mayflower Pilgrims, And The Impacts Of English Settlement"

The woman suffrage movement challenged the belief that respectable women should not mix indiscriminately with men; in antebellum America, women who appeared in a promiscuous crowd were considered sexually available (Lebsock, 1984). On this panel, scholars working in different historical eras and employing a variety of research methods examine the ways public spaces in the urban United States were segregated and integrated, mapping their uses by individuals and groups.  These papers illuminate how different bodies characterized by race, gender, class, and sexuality, interacted with, created, and mapped meaning onto urban neighborhoods and public buildings, and in turn, how experiences of and in public spaces have given meaning to the bodies moving through them. Lauren Santangelo begins in the period 1870-1917 with her work on Mapping the Suffrage Metropolis (mappingsuffrage.com), a digital humanities initiative that layers the location of hundreds of suffrage meetings onto georeferenced fire insurance maps of New York City. Moving to the turn of the twentieth century, Rachel Boyle examines urban networks of women who publicly engaged in an intimate economy of drinking, prostitution, and thievery in Chicago, while Paula Austin examines the racialized space and spatialized race of Washington, D.C. as the growing federal presence expanded into predominantly and historically black and poor areas of the city. Finally, Molly Brookfield discusses the normalization of catcalling, ogling, and other forms of gender-based street harassment in American cities in the 1930s and 1940s.

Most often, such history lacks the voices of ordinary people. Debates over transportation, infrastructure, architecture, and places center heavily on policy and politics, and while people are involved, the voices of ordinary citizens are often stifled by the larger, more gregarious voices of politicians and policymakers. This panel will borrow from recent historiographical developments that places institutional and local perspectives alongside each other in examining the cultural implications of Americas built environment. These perspectives are particularly important in infrastructure as Americans experienced urbanization; professionalized expertise; and mass development, but also individuals and families faced disruptions in their local communities that required them to reconcile their stake in the politicization of local and national infrastructure. The significance of spatial autonomy in 20th-century America is best examined by the development and engineering of our physical environment. By examining the complex ways that corporations, the state, and individuals construct and reconstruct the liminal spaces within and among urban, suburban, and rural environments—as well as honing in on identity formation of any given place as it is shaped by the materiality of its infrastructure—historians can demonstrate the complex relationship between institutional structure and individual agency that built American society over the past century. </p>","Streets Are For People Too!: Community, Infrastructure, And Contested Spaces In 20th-Century America"
